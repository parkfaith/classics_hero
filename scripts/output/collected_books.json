        "content": "I determined to give a week's strict attention to each of the virtues\nsuccessively. Thus, in the first week, my great guard was to avoid every\nthe least offence against Temperance, leaving the other virtues to their\nordinary chance, only marking every evening the faults of the day. Thus,\nif in the first week I could keep my first line, marked T, clear of\nspots, I suppos'd the habit of that virtue so much strengthen'd, and its\nopposite weaken'd, that I might venture extending my attention to\ninclude the next, and for the following week keep both lines clear of\nspots. Proceeding thus to the last, I could go thro' a course compleat\nin thirteen weeks, and four courses in a year. And like him who, having\na garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at\nonce, which would exceed his reach and his strength, but works on one of\nthe beds at a time, and, having accomplish'd the first, proceeds to a\nsecond, so I should have, I hoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on\nmy pages the progress I made in virtue, by clearing successively my\nlines of their spots, till in the end, by a number of courses, I should\nbe happy in viewing a clean book, after a thirteen weeks' daily\nexamination.\n\nThis my little book had for its motto these lines from Addison's Cato:\n\n\"Here will I hold. If there's a power above us\n(And that there is, all nature cries aloud\nThro' all her works), He must delight in virtue;\nAnd that which he delights in must be happy.\"\n\nAnother from Cicero,\n\n\"O vitæ Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix expultrixque vitiorum!\nUnus dies, bene et ex præceptis tuis actus, peccanti immortalitati est\nanteponendus.\"\n\nAnother from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of wisdom or virtue:\n\n\"Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and\nhonour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\""

        "content": "And conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I thought it right and\nnecessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it; to this end I\nformed the following little prayer, which was prefix'd to my tables of\nexamination, for daily use.\n\n\"O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! merciful Guide! Increase in me\nthat wisdom which discovers my truest interest. Strengthen my\nresolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates. Accept my kind offices\nto thy other children as the only return in my power for thy continual\nfavors to me.\"\n\nI used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomson's Poems,\nviz.:\n\n\"Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme!\nO teach me what is good; teach me Thyself!\nSave me from folly, vanity, and vice,\nFrom every low pursuit; and fill my soul\nWith knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure;\nSacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!\"\n\nThe precept of Order requiring that every part of my business should\nhave its allotted time, one page in my little book contain'd the\nfollowing scheme of employment for the twenty-four hours of a natural\nday:\n\nTHE MORNING.         { 5}   Rise, wash, and address Powerful\nQuestion.            { 6}   Goodness!

I was\nsurpris'd to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined;\nbut I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish. To avoid the trouble\nof renewing now and then my little book, which, by scraping out the\nmarks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in a new\ncourse, became full of holes, I transferr'd my tables and precepts to\nthe ivory leaves of a memorandum book, on which the lines were drawn\nwith red ink, that made a durable stain, and on those lines I mark'd my\nfaults with a black-lead pencil, which marks I could easily wipe out\nwith a wet sponge. After a while I went thro' one course only in a year,\nand afterward only one in several years, till at length I omitted them\nentirely, being employ'd in voyages and business abroad, with a\nmultiplicity of affairs that interfered; but I always carried my little\nbook with me.\n\nMy scheme of Order gave me the most trouble; and I found that, tho' it\nmight be practicable where a man's business was such as to leave him the\ndisposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer, for instance, it\nwas not possible to be exactly observed by a master, who must mix with\nthe world, and often receive people of business at their own hours.\nOrder, too, with regard to places for things, papers, etc., I found\nextreamly difficult to acquire. I had not been early accustomed to it,\nand, having an exceeding good memory, I was not so sensible of the\ninconvenience attending want of method. This article, therefore, cost me\nso much painful attention, and my faults in it vexed me so much, and I\nmade so little progress in amendment, and had such frequent relapses,\nthat I was almost ready to give up the attempt, and content myself with\na faulty character in that respect, like the man who, in buying an ax of\na smith, my neighbour, desired to have the whole of its surface as\nbright as the edge. The smith consented to grind it bright for him if he\nwould turn the wheel; he turn'd, while the smith press'd the broad face\nof the ax hard and heavily on the stone, which made the turning of it\nvery fatiguing. The man came every now and then from the wheel to see\nhow the work went on, and at length would take his ax as it was, without\nfarther grinding. \"No,\" said the smith, \"turn on, turn on; we shall have\nit bright by-and-by; as yet, it is only speckled.\" \"Yes,\" said the man,\n\"but I think I like a speckled ax best.\" And I believe this may have\nbeen the case with many, who, having, for want of some such means as I\nemploy'd, found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad habits\nin other points of vice and virtue, have given up the struggle, and\nconcluded that \"a speckled ax was best\"; for something, that pretended\nto be reason, was every now and then suggesting to me that such extream\nnicety as I exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals,\nwhich, if it were known, would make me ridiculous; that a perfect\ncharacter might be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and\nhated; and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself,\nto keep his friends in countenance.\n\nIn truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order; and now I\nam grown old, and my memory bad, I feel very sensibly the want of it.\nBut, on the whole, tho' I never arrived at the perfection I had been so\nambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the\nendeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been\nif I had not attempted it; as those who aim at perfect writing by\nimitating the engraved copies, tho' they never reach the wish'd-for\nexcellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavor, and is\ntolerable while it continues fair and legible.\n\nIt may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little\nartifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor ow'd the constant\nfelicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which this is written.\nWhat reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of Providence;\nbut, if they arrive, the reflection on past happiness enjoy'd ought to\nhelp his bearing them with more resignation. To Temperance he ascribes\nhis long-continued health, and what is still left to him of a good\nconstitution; to Industry and Frugality, the early easiness of his\ncircumstances and acquisition of his fortune, with all that knowledge\nthat enabled him to be a useful citizen, and obtained for him some\ndegree of reputation among the learned; to Sincerity and Justice, the\nconfidence of his country, and the honorable employs it conferred upon\nhim; and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues, even\nin the imperfect state he was able to acquire them, all that evenness of\ntemper, and that cheerfulness in conversation, which makes his company\nstill sought for, and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance. I\nhope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and\nreap the benefit.\n\nIt will be remark'd that, tho' my scheme was not wholly without\nreligion, there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets of\nany particular sect. I had purposely avoided them; for, being fully\npersuaded of the utility and excellency of my method, and that it might\nbe serviceable to people in all religions, and intending some time or\nother to publish it, I would not have any thing in it that should\nprejudice any one, of any sect, against it. I purposed writing a little\ncomment on each virtue, in which I would have shown the advantages of\npossessing it, and the mischiefs attending its opposite vice; and I\nshould have called my book The Art of Virtue, [7] because it would have\nshown the means and manner of obtaining virtue, which would have\ndistinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good, that does not\ninstruct and indicate the means, but is like the apostle's man of verbal\ncharity, who only without showing to the naked and hungry how or where\nthey might get clothes or victuals, exhorted them to be fed and\nclothed.--James ii. 15, 16.\n\n[7] Nothing so likely to make a man's fortune as virtue.--[Marg. note.]"

        "content": "But it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this\ncomment was never fulfilled. I did, indeed, from time to time, put down\nshort hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to be made use of in\nit, some of which I have still by me; but the necessary close attention\nto private business in the earlier part of my life, and public business\nsince, have occasioned my postponing it; for, it being connected in my\nmind with a great and extensive project, that required the whole man to\nexecute, and which an unforeseen succession of employs prevented my\nattending to, it has hitherto remain'd unfinish'd.\n\nIn this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine,\nthat vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden, but\nforbidden because they are hurtful, the nature of man alone considered;\nthat it was, therefore, every one's interest to be virtuous who wish'd\nto be happy even in this world; and I should, from this circumstance\n(there being always in the world a number of rich merchants, nobility,\nstates, and princes, who have need of honest instruments for the\nmanagement of their affairs, and such being so rare), have endeavored to\nconvince young persons that no qualities were so likely to make a poor\nman's fortune as those of probity and integrity.\n\nMy list of virtues contain'd at first but twelve; but a Quaker friend\nhaving kindly informed me that I was generally thought proud; that my\npride show'd itself frequently in conversation; that I was not content\nwith being in the right when discussing any point, but was overbearing,\nand rather insolent, of which he convinc'd me by mentioning several\ninstances; I determined endeavouring to cure myself, if I could, of this\nvice or folly among the rest, and I added Humility to my list, giving an\nextensive meaning to the word.\n\nI cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this virtue,\nbut I had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it. I made it a\nrule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of others,\nand all positive assertion of my own. I even forbid myself, agreeably to\nthe old laws of our Junto, the use of every word or expression in the\nlanguage that imported a fix'd opinion, such as certainly, undoubtedly,\netc., and I adopted, instead of them, I conceive, I apprehend, or I\nimagine a thing to be so or so; or it so appears to me at present. When\nanother asserted something that I thought an error, I deny'd myself the\npleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some\nabsurdity in his proposition; and in answering I began by observing that\nin certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the\npresent case there appear'd or seem'd to me some difference, etc. I soon\nfound the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I\nengag'd in went on more pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos'd\nmy opinions procur'd them a readier reception and less contradiction; I\nhad less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more\neasily prevail'd with others to give up their mistakes and join with me\nwhen I happened to be in the right.\n\nAnd this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural\ninclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual to me, that\nperhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical\nexpression escape me. And to this habit (after my character of\nintegrity) I think it principally owing that I had early so much weight\nwith my fellow-citizens when I proposed new institutions, or alterations\nin the old, and so much influence in public councils when I became a\nmember; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent, subject to much\nhesitation in my choice of words, hardly correct in language, and yet I\ngenerally carried my points.\n\nIn reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard to\nsubdue as pride. Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down, stifle it,\nmortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and will every now\nand then peep out and show itself; you will see it, perhaps, often in\nthis history; for, even if I could conceive that I had compleatly\novercome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.\n\n[Thus far written at Passy, 1784.]\n\n[\"I am now about to write at home, August, 1788, but can not have the\nhelp expected from my papers, many of them being lost in the war. I\nhave, however, found the following.\"] [8]\n\nHaving mentioned a great and extensive project which I had conceiv'd, it\nseems proper that some account should be here given of that project and\nits object. Its first rise in my mind appears in the following little\npaper, accidentally preserv'd, viz.:\n\n[8] This is a marginal memorandum.--B.\n\nObservations on my reading history, in Library, May 19th, 1731.\n\n\"That the great affairs of the world, the wars, revolutions, etc., are\ncarried on and affected by parties.\n\n\"That the view of these parties is their present general interest, or\nwhat they take to be such.\n\n\"That the different views of these different parties occasion all\nconfusion.\n\n\"That while a party is carrying on a general design, each man has his\nparticular private interest in view.\n\n\"That as soon as a party has gain'd its general point, each member\nbecomes intent upon his particular interest; which, thwarting others,\nbreaks that party into divisions, and occasions more confusion.\n\n\"That few in public affairs act from a meer view of the good of their\ncountry, whatever they may pretend; and, tho' their actings bring real\ngood to their country, yet men primarily considered that their own and\ntheir country's interest was united, and did not act from a principle of\nbenevolence.\n\n\"That fewer still, in public affairs, act with a view to the good of\nmankind.\n\n\"There seems to me at present to be great occasion for raising a United\nParty for Virtue, by forming the virtuous and good men of all nations\ninto a regular body, to be govern'd by suitable good and wise rules,\nwhich good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in their\nobedience to, than common people are to common laws.\n\n\"I at present think that whoever attempts this aright, and is well\nqualified, can not fail of pleasing God, and of meeting with success.\n\nB. F.\"\n\nRevolving this project in my mind, as to be undertaken hereafter, when\nmy circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure, I put down from\ntime to time, on pieces of paper, such thoughts as occurr'd to me\nrespecting it. Most of these are lost; but I find one purporting to be\nthe substance of an intended creed, containing, as I thought, the\nessentials of every known religion, and being free of every thing that\nmight shock the professors of any religion. It is express'd in these\nwords, viz.:\n\n\"That there is one God, who made all things.\n\n\"That he governs the world by his providence.\n\n\"That he ought to be worshiped by adoration, prayer, and thanksgiving.\n\n\"But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to man.\n\n\"That the soul is immortal.\n\n\"And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice, either here\nor hereafter.\" [9]\n\n[9] In the Middle Ages, Franklin, if such a phenomenon as Franklin were\npossible in the Middle Ages, would probably have been the founder of a\nmonastic order.--B."

        "content": "My ideas at that time were, that the sect should be begun and spread at\nfirst among young and single men only; that each person to be initiated\nshould not only declare his assent to such creed, but should have\nexercised himself with the thirteen weeks' examination and practice of\nthe virtues, as in the before-mention'd model; that the existence of\nsuch a society should be kept a secret, till it was become considerable,\nto prevent solicitations for the admission of improper persons, but that\nthe members should each of them search among his acquaintance for\ningenuous, well-disposed youths, to whom, with prudent caution, the\nscheme should be gradually communicated; that the members should engage\nto afford their advice, assistance, and support to each other in\npromoting one another's interests, business, and advancement in life;\nthat, for distinction, we should be call'd The Society of the Free and\nEasy: free, as being, by the general practice and habit of the virtues,\nfree from the dominion of vice; and particularly by the practice of\nindustry and frugality, free from debt, which exposes a man to\nconfinement, and a species of slavery to his creditors.\n\nThis is as much as I can now recollect of the project, except that I\ncommunicated it in part to two young men, who adopted it with some\nenthusiasm; but my then narrow circumstances, and the necessity I was\nunder of sticking close to my business, occasion'd my postponing the\nfurther prosecution of it at that time; and my multifarious occupations,\npublic and private, induc'd me to continue postponing, so that it has\nbeen omitted till I have no longer strength or activity left sufficient\nfor such an enterprise; tho' I am still of opinion that it was a\npracticable scheme, and might have been very useful, by forming a great\nnumber of good citizens; and I was not discourag'd by the seeming\nmagnitude of the undertaking, as I have always thought that one man of\ntolerable abilities may work great changes, and accomplish great affairs\namong mankind, if he first forms a good plan, and, cutting off all\namusements or other employments that would divert his attention, makes\nthe execution of that same plan his sole study and business.\n\nIn 1732 I first publish'd my Almanack, under the name of Richard\nSaunders; it was continu'd by me about twenty-five years, commonly\ncall'd Poor Richard's Almanac. I endeavor'd to make it both entertaining\nand useful, and it accordingly came to be in such demand, that I reap'd\nconsiderable profit from it, vending annually near ten thousand. And\nobserving that it was generally read, scarce any neighborhood in the\nprovince being without it, I consider'd it as a proper vehicle for\nconveying instruction among the common people, who bought scarcely any\nother books; I therefore filled all the little spaces that occurr'd\nbetween the remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial sentences,\nchiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality, as the means of\nprocuring wealth, and thereby securing virtue; it being more difficult\nfor a man in want, to act always honestly, as, to use here one of those\nproverbs, it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright.\n\nThese proverbs, which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations, I\nassembled and form'd into a connected discourse prefix'd to the Almanack\nof 1757, as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending an\nauction. The bringing all these scatter'd counsels thus into a focus\nenabled them to make greater impression. The piece, being universally\napproved, was copied in all the newspapers of the Continent; reprinted\nin Britain on a broad side, to be stuck up in houses; two translations\nwere made of it in French, and great numbers bought by the clergy and\ngentry, to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants.\nIn Pennsylvania, as it discouraged useless expense in foreign\nsuperfluities, some thought it had its share of influence in producing\nthat growing plenty of money which was observable for several years\nafter its publication.\n\nI considered my newspaper, also, as another means of communicating\ninstruction, and in that view frequently reprinted in it extracts from\nthe Spectator, and other moral writers; and sometimes publish'd little\npieces of my own, which had been first compos'd for reading in our\nJunto. Of these are a Socratic dialogue, tending to prove that, whatever\nmight be his parts and abilities, a vicious man could not properly be\ncalled a man of sense; and a discourse on self-denial, showing that\nvirtue was not secure till its practice became a habitude, and was free\nfrom the opposition of contrary inclinations. These may be found in the\npapers about the beginning of 1735.\n\nIn the conduct of my newspaper, I carefully excluded all libelling and\npersonal abuse, which is of late years become so disgraceful to our\ncountry. Whenever I was solicited to insert anything of that kind, and\nthe writers pleaded, as they generally did, the liberty of the press,\nand that a newspaper was like a stage-coach, in which any one who would\npay had a right to a place, my answer was, that I would print the piece\nseparately if desired, and the author might have as many copies as he\npleased to distribute himself, but that I would not take upon me to\nspread his detraction; and that, having contracted with my subscribers\nto furnish them with what might be either useful or entertaining, I\ncould not fill their papers with private altercation, in which they had\nno concern, without doing them manifest injustice. Now, many of our\nprinters make no scruple of gratifying the malice of individuals by\nfalse accusations of the fairest characters among ourselves, augmenting\nanimosity even to the producing of duels; and are, moreover, so\nindiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on the government of\nneighboring states, and even on the conduct of our best national allies,\nwhich may be attended with the most pernicious consequences. These\nthings I mention as a caution to young printers, and that they may be\nencouraged not to pollute their presses and disgrace their profession by\nsuch infamous practices, but refuse steadily, as they may see by my\nexample that such a course of conduct will not, on the whole, be\ninjurious to their interests.\n\nIn 1733 I sent one of my journeymen to Charleston, South Carolina, where\na printer was wanting. I furnish'd him with a press and letters, on an\nagreement of partnership, by which I was to receive one-third of the\nprofits of the business, paying one-third of the expense. He was a man\nof learning, and honest but ignorant in matters of account; and, tho' he\nsometimes made me remittances, I could get no account from him, nor any\nsatisfactory state of our partnership while he lived. On his decease,\nthe business was continued by his widow, who, being born and bred in\nHolland, where, as I have been inform'd, the knowledge of accounts makes\na part of female education, she not only sent me as clear a state as she\ncould find of the transactions past, but continued to account with the\ngreatest regularity and exactness every quarter afterwards, and managed\nthe business with such success, that she not only brought up reputably a\nfamily of children, but, at the expiration of the term, was able to\npurchase of me the printing-house, and establish her son in it.\n\nI mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branch\nof education for our young females, as likely to be of more use to them\nand their children, in case of widowhood, than either music or dancing,\nby preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men, and enabling\nthem to continue, perhaps, a profitable mercantile house, with\nestablish'd correspondence, till a son is grown up fit to undertake and\ngo on with it, to the lasting advantage and enriching of the family."

        "content": "About the year 1734 there arrived among us from Ireland a young\nPresbyterian preacher, named Hemphill, who delivered with a good voice,\nand apparently extempore, most excellent discourses, which drew together\nconsiderable numbers of different persuasion, who join'd in admiring\nthem. Among the rest, I became one of his constant hearers, his sermons\npleasing me, as they had little of the dogmatical kind, but inculcated\nstrongly the practice of virtue, or what in the religious stile are\ncalled good works. Those, however, of our congregation, who considered\nthemselves as orthodox Presbyterians, disapprov'd his doctrine, and were\njoin'd by most of the old clergy, who arraign'd him of heterodoxy before\nthe synod, in order to have him silenc'd. I became his zealous partisan,\nand contributed all I could to raise a party in his favour, and we\ncombated for him a while with some hopes of success. There was much\nscribbling pro and con upon the occasion; and finding that, tho' an\nelegant preacher, he was but a poor writer, I lent him my pen and wrote\nfor him two or three pamphlets, and one piece in the Gazette of April,\n1735. Those pamphlets, as is generally the case with controversial\nwritings, tho' eagerly read at the time, were soon out of vogue, and I\nquestion whether a single copy of them now exists.\n\nDuring the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly. One\nof our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that was much\nadmired, thought he had somewhere read the sermon before, or at least a\npart of it. On search he found that part quoted at length, in one of the\nBritish Reviews, from a discourse of Dr. Foster's. This detection gave\nmany of our party disgust, who accordingly abandoned his cause, and\noccasion'd our more speedy discomfiture in the synod. I stuck by him,\nhowever, as I rather approv'd his giving us good sermons compos'd by\nothers, than bad ones of his own manufacture, tho' the latter was the\npractice of our common teachers. He afterward acknowledg'd to me that\nnone of those he preach'd were his own; adding, that his memory was such\nas enabled him to retain and repeat any sermon after one reading only.\nOn our defeat, he left us in search elsewhere of better fortune, and I\nquitted the congregation, never joining it after, tho' I continu'd many\nyears my subscription for the support of its ministers.\n\nI had begun in 1733 to study languages; I soon made myself so much a\nmaster of the French as to be able to read the books with ease. I then\nundertook the Italian. An acquaintance, who was also learning it, us'd\noften to tempt me to play chess with him. Finding this took up too much\nof the time I had to spare for study, I at length refus'd to play any\nmore, unless on this condition, that the victor in every game should\nhave a right to impose a task, either in parts of the grammar to be got\nby heart, or in translations, etc., which tasks the vanquish'd was to\nperform upon honour, before our next meeting. As we play'd pretty\nequally, we thus beat one another into that language. I afterwards with\na little painstaking, acquir'd as much of the Spanish as to read their\nbooks also.\n\nI have already mention'd that I had only one year's instruction in a\nLatin school, and that when very young, after which I neglected that\nlanguage entirely. But, when I had attained an acquaintance with the\nFrench, Italian, and Spanish, I was surpriz'd to find, on looking over a\nLatin Testament, that I understood so much more of that language than I\nhad imagined, which encouraged me to apply myself again to the study of\nit, and I met with more success, as those preceding languages had\ngreatly smooth'd my way.\n\nFrom these circumstances, I have thought that there is some\ninconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages. We are told that\nit is proper to begin first with the Latin, and, having acquir'd that,\nit will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are deriv'd\nfrom it; and yet we do not begin with the Greek, in order more easily to\nacquire the Latin. It is true that, if you can clamber and get to the\ntop of a staircase without using the steps, you will more easily gain\nthem in descending; but certainly, if you begin with the lowest you will\nwith more ease ascend to the top; and I would therefore offer it to the\nconsideration of those who superintend the education of our youth,\nwhether, since many of those who begin with the Latin quit the same\nafter spending some years without having made any great proficiency, and\nwhat they have learnt becomes almost useless, so that their time has\nbeen lost, it would not have been better to have begun with the French,\nproceeding to the Italian, etc.; for, tho', after spending the same\ntime, they should quit the study of languages and never arrive at the\nLatin, they would, however, have acquired another tongue or two, that,\nbeing in modern use, might be serviceable to them in common life.\n\nAfter ten years' absence from Boston, and having become easy in my\ncircumstances, I made a journey thither to visit my relations, which I\ncould not sooner well afford. In returning, I call'd at Newport to see\nmy brother, then settled there with his printing-house. Our former\ndifferences were forgotten, and our meeting was very cordial and\naffectionate. He was fast declining in his health, and requested of me\nthat, in case of his death, which he apprehended not far distant, I\nwould take home his son, then but ten years of age, and bring him up to\nthe printing business. This I accordingly perform'd, sending him a few\nyears to school before I took him into the office. His mother carried on\nthe business till he was grown up, when I assisted him with an\nassortment of new types, those of his father being in a manner worn out.\nThus it was that I made my brother ample amends for the service I had\ndepriv'd him of by leaving him so early.\n\nIn 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the\nsmall-pox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and still\nregret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for\nthe sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that\nthey should never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my\nexample showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that,\ntherefore, the safer should be chosen.\n\nOur club, the Junto, was found so useful, and afforded such satisfaction\nto the members, that several were desirous of introducing their friends,\nwhich could not well be done without exceeding what we had settled as a\nconvenient number, viz., twelve. We had from the beginning made it a\nrule to keep our institution a secret, which was pretty well observ'd;\nthe intention was to avoid applications of improper persons for\nadmittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might find it difficult to refuse.\nI was one of those who were against any addition to our number, but,\ninstead of it, made in writing a proposal, that every member separately\nshould endeavor to form a subordinate club, with the same rules\nrespecting queries, etc., and without informing them of the connection\nwith the Junto. The advantages proposed were, the improvement of so many\nmore young citizens by the use of our institutions; our better\nacquaintance with the general sentiments of the inhabitants on any\noccasion, as the Junto member might propose what queries we should\ndesire, and was to report to the Junto what pass'd in his separate club;\nthe promotion of our particular interests in business by more extensive\nrecommendation, and the increase of our influence in public affairs, and\nour power of doing good by spreading thro' the several clubs the\nsentiments of the Junto."

        "content": "The project was approv'd, and every member undertook to form his club,\nbut they did not all succeed. Five or six only were compleated, which\nwere called by different names, as the Vine, the Union, the Band, etc.\nThey were useful to themselves, and afforded us a good deal of\namusement, information, and instruction, besides answering, in some\nconsiderable degree, our views of influencing the public opinion on\nparticular occasions, of which I shall give some instances in course of\ntime as they happened.\n\nMy first promotion was my being chosen, in 1736, clerk of the General\nAssembly. The choice was made that year without opposition; but the year\nfollowing, when I was again propos'd (the choice, like that of the\nmembers, being annual), a new member made a long speech against me, in\norder to favour some other candidate. I was, however, chosen, which was\nthe more agreeable to me, as, besides the pay for the immediate service\nas clerk, the place gave me a better opportunity of keeping up an\ninterest among the members, which secur'd to me the business of printing\nthe votes, laws, paper money, and other occasional jobbs for the public,\nthat, on the whole, were very profitable.\n\nI therefore did not like the opposition of this new member, who was a\ngentleman of fortune and education, with talents that were likely to\ngive him, in time, great influence in the House, which, indeed,\nafterwards happened. I did not, however, aim at gaining his favour by\npaying any servile respect to him, but, after some time, took this other\nmethod. Having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce\nand curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire of\nperusing that book, and requesting he would do me the favour of lending\nit to me for a few days. He sent it immediately, and I return'd it in\nabout a week with another note, expressing strongly my sense of the\nfavour. When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had\nnever done before), and with great civility; and he ever after\nmanifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became\ngreat friends, and our friendship continued to his death. This is\nanother instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which says,\n\"He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you\nanother, than he whom you yourself have obliged.\" And it shows how much\nmore profitable it is prudently to remove, than to resent, return, and\ncontinue inimical proceedings.\n\nIn 1737, Colonel Spotswood, late governor of Virginia, and then\npostmaster-general, being dissatisfied with the conduct of his deputy at\nPhiladelphia, respecting some negligence in rendering, and inexactitude\nof his accounts, took from him the commission and offered it to me. I\naccepted it readily, and found it of great advantage; for, tho' the\nsalary was small, it facilitated the correspondence that improv'd my\nnewspaper, increas'd the number demanded, as well as the advertisements\nto be inserted, so that it came to afford me a considerable income. My\nold competitor's newspaper declin'd proportionably, and I was satisfy'd\nwithout retaliating his refusal, while postmaster, to permit my papers\nbeing carried by the riders. Thus he suffer'd greatly from his neglect\nin due accounting; and I mention it as a lesson to those young men who\nmay be employ'd in managing affairs for others, that they should always\nrender accounts, and make remittances, with great clearness and\npunctuality. The character of observing such a conduct is the most\npowerful of all recommendations to new employments and increase of\nbusiness.\n\nI began now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs, beginning,\nhowever, with small matters. The city watch was one of the first things\nthat I conceiv'd to want regulation. It was managed by the constables of\nthe respective wards in turn; the constable warned a number of\nhousekeepers to attend him for the night. Those who chose never to\nattend paid him six shillings a year to be excus'd, which was suppos'd\nto be for hiring substitutes, but was, in reality, much more than was\nnecessary for that purpose, and made the constableship a place of\nprofit; and the constable, for a little drink, often got such\nragamuffins about him as a watch, that respectable housekeepers did not\nchoose to mix with. Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected, and\nmost of the nights spent in tippling. I thereupon wrote a paper to be\nread in Junto, representing these irregularities, but insisting more\nparticularly on the inequality of this six-shilling tax of the\nconstables, respecting the circumstances of those who paid it, since a\npoor widow housekeeper, all whose property to be guarded by the watch\ndid not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid as much as the\nwealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds' worth of goods in his\nstores.\n\nOn the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the hiring of proper\nmen to serve constantly in that business; and as a more equitable way of\nsupporting the charge the levying a tax that should be proportion'd to\nthe property. This idea, being approv'd by the Junto, was communicated\nto the other clubs, but as arising in each of them; and though the plan\nwas not immediately carried into execution, yet, by preparing the minds\nof people for the change, it paved the way for the law obtained a few\nyears after, when the members of our clubs were grown into more\ninfluence.\n\nAbout this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in Junto, but it was\nafterward publish'd) on the different accidents and carelessnesses by\nwhich houses were set on fire, with cautions against them, and means\nproposed of avoiding them. This was much spoken of as a useful piece,\nand gave rise to a project, which soon followed it, of forming a company\nfor the more ready extinguishing of fires, and mutual assistance in\nremoving and securing the goods when in danger. Associates in this\nscheme were presently found, amounting to thirty. Our articles of\nagreement oblig'd every member to keep always in good order, and fit for\nuse, a certain number of leather buckets, with strong bags and baskets\n(for packing and transporting of goods), which were to be brought to\nevery fire; and we agreed to meet once a month and spend a social\nevening together, in discoursing and communicating such ideas as\noccurred to us upon the subject of fires, as might be useful in our\nconduct on such occasions.\n\nThe utility of this institution soon appeared, and many more desiring to\nbe admitted than we thought convenient for one company, they were\nadvised to form another, which was accordingly done; and this went on,\none new company being formed after another, till they became so numerous\nas to include most of the inhabitants who were men of property; and now,\nat the time of my writing this, tho' upward of fifty years since its\nestablishment, that which I first formed, called the Union Fire Company,\nstill subsists and flourishes, tho' the first members are all deceas'd\nbut myself and one, who is older by a year than I am. The small fines\nthat have been paid by members for absence at the monthly meetings have\nbeen apply'd to the purchase of fire-engines, ladders, fire-hooks, and\nother useful implements for each company, so that I question whether\nthere is a city in the world better provided with the means of putting a\nstop to beginning conflagrations; and, in fact, since these\ninstitutions, the city has never lost by fire more than one or two\nhouses at a time, and the flames have often been extinguished before the\nhouse in which they began has been half consumed."

        "content": "In 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr. Whitefield, who\nhad made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher. He was at\nfirst permitted to preach in some of our churches; but the clergy,\ntaking a dislike to him, soon refus'd him their pulpits, and he was\noblig'd to preach in the fields. The multitudes of all sects and\ndenominations that attended his sermons were enormous, and it was matter\nof speculation to me, who was one of the number, to observe the\nextraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers, and how much they\nadmir'd and respected him, notwithstanding his common abuse of them, by\nassuring them that they were naturally half beasts and half devils. It\nwas wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our\ninhabitants. From being thoughtless or indifferent about religion, it\nseem'd as if all the world were growing religious, so that one could not\nwalk thro' the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in\ndifferent families of every street.\n\nAnd it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air, subject to\nits inclemencies, the building of a house to meet in was no sooner\npropos'd, and persons appointed to receive contributions, but sufficient\nsums were soon receiv'd to procure the ground and erect the building,\nwhich was one hundred feet long and seventy broad, about the size of\nWestminster Hall; and the work was carried on with such spirit as to be\nfinished in a much shorter time than could have been expected. Both\nhouse and ground were vested in trustees, expressly for the use of any\npreacher of any religious persuasion who might desire to say something\nto the people at Philadelphia; the design in building not being to\naccommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants in general; so that\neven if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach\nMohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service.\n\nMr. Whitefield, in leaving us, went preaching all the way thro' the\ncolonies to Georgia. The settlement of that province had lately been\nbegun, but, instead of being made with hardy, industrious husbandmen,\naccustomed to labor, the only people fit for such an enterprise, it was\nwith families of broken shop-keepers and other insolvent debtors, many\nof indolent and idle habits, taken out of the jails, who, being set down\nin the woods, unqualified for clearing land, and unable to endure the\nhardships of a new settlement, perished in numbers, leaving many\nhelpless children unprovided for. The sight of their miserable situation\ninspir'd the benevolent heart of Mr. Whitefield with the idea of\nbuilding an Orphan House there, in which they might be supported and\neducated. Returning northward, he preach'd up this charity, and made\nlarge collections, for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the\nhearts and purses of his hearers, of which I myself was an instance.\n\nI did not disapprove of the design, but, as Georgia was then destitute\nof materials and workmen, and it was proposed to send them from\nPhiladelphia at a great expense, I thought it would have been better to\nhave built the house here, and brought the children to it. This I\nadvis'd; but he was resolute in his first project, rejected my counsel,\nand I therefore refus'd to contribute. I happened soon after to attend\none of his sermons, in the course of which I perceived he intended to\nfinish with a collection, and I silently resolved he should get nothing\nfrom me. I had in my pocket a handful of copper money, three or four\nsilver dollars, and five pistoles in gold. As he proceeded I began to\nsoften, and concluded to give the coppers. Another stroke of his oratory\nmade me asham'd of that, and determin'd me to give the silver; and he\nfinish'd so admirably, that I empty'd my pocket wholly into the\ncollector's dish, gold and all. At this sermon there was also one of our\nclub, who, being of my sentiments respecting the building in Georgia,\nand suspecting a collection might be intended, had, by precaution,\nemptied his pockets before he came from home. Towards the conclusion of\nthe discourse, however, he felt a strong desire to give, and apply'd to\na neighbour, who stood near him, to borrow some money for the purpose.\nThe application was unfortunately [made] to perhaps the only man in the\ncompany who had the firmness not to be affected by the preacher. His\nanswer was, \"At any other time, Friend Hopkinson, I would lend to thee\nfreely; but not now, for thee seems to be out of thy right senses.\"\n\nSome of Mr. Whitefield's enemies affected to suppose that he would apply\nthese collections to his own private emolument; but I who was intimately\nacquainted with him (being employed in printing his Sermons and\nJournals, etc.), never had the least suspicion of his integrity, but am\nto this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct a\nperfectly honest man, and methinks my testimony in his favour ought to\nhave the more weight, as we had no religious connection. He us'd,\nindeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion, but never had the\nsatisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard. Ours was a mere\ncivil friendship, sincere on both sides, and lasted to his death.\n\nThe following instance will show something of the terms on which we\nstood. Upon one of his arrivals from England at Boston, he wrote to me\nthat he should come soon to Philadelphia, but knew not where he could\nlodge when there, as he understood his old friend and host, Mr. Benezet,\nwas removed to Germantown. My answer was, \"You know my house; if you can\nmake shift with its scanty accommodations, you will be most heartily\nwelcome.\" He reply'd, that if I made that kind offer for Christ's sake,\nI should not miss of a reward. And I returned, \"Don't let me be\nmistaken; it was not for Christ's sake, but for your sake.\" One of our\ncommon acquaintance jocosely remark'd, that, knowing it to be the custom\nof the saints, when they received any favour, to shift the burden of the\nobligation from off their own shoulders, and place it in heaven, I had\ncontriv'd to fix it on earth.\n\nThe last time I saw Mr. Whitefield was in London, when he consulted me\nabout his Orphan House concern, and his purpose of appropriating it to\nthe establishment of a college.\n\nHe had a loud and clear voice, and articulated his words and sentences\nso perfectly, that he might be heard and understood at a great distance,\nespecially as his auditories, however numerous, observ'd the most exact\nsilence. He preach'd one evening from the top of the Court-house steps,\nwhich are in the middle of Market-street, and on the west side of\nSecond-street, which crosses it at right angles. Both streets were\nfill'd with his hearers to a considerable distance. Being among the\nhindmost in Market-street, I had the curiosity to learn how far he could\nbe heard, by retiring backwards down the street towards the river; and I\nfound his voice distinct till I came near Front-street, when some noise\nin that street obscur'd it. Imagining then a semi-circle, of which my\ndistance should be the radius, and that it were fill'd with auditors, to\neach of whom I allow'd two square feet, I computed that he might well be\nheard by more than thirty thousand. This reconcil'd me to the newspaper\naccounts of his having preach'd to twenty-five thousand people in the\nfields, and to the ancient histories of generals haranguing whole\narmies, of which I had sometimes doubted."

        "content": "By hearing him often, I came to distinguish easily between sermons newly\ncompos'd, and those which he had often preach'd in the course of his\ntravels. His delivery of the latter was so improv'd by frequent\nrepetitions that every accent, every emphasis, every modulation of\nvoice, was so perfectly well turn'd and well plac'd, that, without being\ninterested in the subject, one could not help being pleas'd with the\ndiscourse; a pleasure of much the same kind with that receiv'd from an\nexcellent piece of musick. This is an advantage itinerant preachers have\nover those who are stationary, as the latter can not well improve their\ndelivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals.\n\nHis writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage to his\nenemies; unguarded expressions, and even erroneous opinions, delivered\nin preaching, might have been afterwards explain'd or qualifi'd by\nsupposing others that might have accompani'd them, or they might have\nbeen deny'd; but litera scripta manet. Critics attack'd his writings\nviolently, and with so much appearance of reason as to diminish the\nnumber of his votaries and prevent their encrease; so that I am of\nopinion if he had never written any thing, he would have left behind him\na much more numerous and important sect, and his reputation might in\nthat case have been still growing, even after his death, as there being\nnothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give him a lower\ncharacter, his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign for him as\ngreat a variety of excellence as their enthusiastic admiration might\nwish him to have possessed.\n\nMy business was now continually augmenting, and my circumstances growing\ndaily easier, my newspaper having become very profitable, as being for a\ntime almost the only one in this and the neighbouring provinces. I\nexperienced, too, the truth of the observation, \"that after getting the\nfirst hundred pound, it is more easy to get the second,\" money itself\nbeing of a prolific nature.\n\nThe partnership at Carolina having succeeded, I was encourag'd to engage\nin others, and to promote several of my workmen, who had behaved well,\nby establishing them with printing-houses in different colonies, on the\nsame terms with that in Carolina. Most of them did well, being enabled\nat the end of our term, six years, to purchase the types of me and go on\nworking for themselves, by which means several families were raised.\nPartnerships often finish in quarrels; but I was happy in this, that\nmine were all carried on and ended amicably, owing, I think, a good deal\nto the precaution of having very explicitly settled, in our articles,\nevery thing to be done by or expected from each partner, so that there\nwas nothing to dispute, which precaution I would therefore recommend to\nall who enter into partnerships; for, whatever esteem partners may have\nfor, and confidence in each other at the time of the contract, little\njealousies and disgusts may arise, with ideas of inequality in the care\nand burden of the business, etc., which are attended often with breach\nof friendship and of the connection, perhaps with lawsuits and other\ndisagreeable consequences.\n\nI had, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with my being\nestablished in Pennsylvania. There were, however, two things that I\nregretted, there being no provision for defense, nor for a compleat\neducation of youth; no militia, nor any college. I therefore, in 1743,\ndrew up a proposal for establishing an academy; and at that time,\nthinking the Reverend Mr. Peters, who was out of employ, a fit person to\nsuperintend such an institution, I communicated the project to him; but\nhe, having more profitable views in the service of the proprietaries,\nwhich succeeded, declin'd the undertaking; and, not knowing another at\nthat time suitable for such a trust, I let the scheme lie a while\ndormant. I succeeded better the next year, 1744, in proposing and\nestablishing a Philosophical Society. The paper I wrote for that purpose\nwill be found among my writings, when collected.\n\nWith respect to defense, Spain having been several years at war against\nGreat Britain, and being at length join'd by France, which brought us\ninto great danger; and the laboured and long-continued endeavour of our\ngovernor, Thomas, to prevail with our Quaker Assembly to pass a militia\nlaw, and make other provisions for the security of the province, having\nproved abortive, I determined to try what might be done by a voluntary\nassociation of the people. To promote this, I first wrote and published\na pamphlet, entitled Plain Truth, in which I stated our defenceless\nsituation in strong lights, with the necessity of union and discipline\nfor our defense, and promis'd to propose in a few days an association,\nto be generally signed for that purpose. The pamphlet had a sudden and\nsurprising effect. I was call'd upon for the instrument of association,\nand having settled the draft of it with a few friends, I appointed a\nmeeting of the citizens in the large building before mentioned. The\nhouse was pretty full; I had prepared a number of printed copies, and\nprovided pens and ink dispers'd all over the room. I harangued them a\nlittle on the subject, read the paper, and explained it, and then\ndistributed the copies, which were eagerly signed, not the least\nobjection being made.\n\nWhen the company separated, and the papers were collected, we found\nabove twelve hundred hands; and, other copies being dispersed in the\ncountry, the subscribers amounted at length to upward of ten thousand.\nThese all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms, formed\nthemselves into companies and regiments, chose their own officers, and\nmet every week to be instructed in the manual exercise, and other parts\nof military discipline. The women, by subscriptions among themselves,\nprovided silk colors, which they presented to the companies, painted\nwith different devices and mottos, which I supplied.\n\nThe officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia regiment, being\nmet, chose me for their colonel; but, conceiving myself unfit, I\ndeclin'd that station, and recommended Mr. Lawrence, a fine person, and\nman of influence, who was accordingly appointed. I then propos'd a\nlottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town, and\nfurnishing it with cannon. It filled expeditiously, and the battery was\nsoon erected, the merlons being fram'd of logs and fill'd with earth. We\nbought some old cannon from Boston, but, these not being sufficient, we\nwrote to England for more, soliciting, at the same time, our\nproprietaries for some assistance, tho' without much expectation of\nobtaining it.\n\nMeanwhile, Colonel Lawrence, William Allen, Abram Taylor, Esqr., and\nmyself were sent to New York by the associators, commission'd to borrow\nsome cannon of Governor Clinton. He at first refus'd us peremptorily;\nbut at dinner with his council, where there was great drinking of\nMadeira wine, as the custom of that place then was, he softened by\ndegrees, and said he would lend us six. After a few more bumpers he\nadvanc'd to ten; and at length he very good-naturedly conceded eighteen.\nThey were fine cannon, eighteen-pounders, with their carriages, which we\nsoon transported and mounted on our battery, where the associators kept\na nightly guard while the war lasted, and among the rest I regularly\ntook my turn of duty there as a common soldier."

        "content": "My activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and\ncouncil; they took me into confidence, and I was consulted by them in\nevery measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the\nassociation. Calling in the aid of religion, I propos'd to them the\nproclaiming a fast, to promote reformation, and implore the blessing of\nHeaven on our undertaking. They embrac'd the motion; but, as it was the\nfirst fast ever thought of in the province, the secretary had no\nprecedent from which to draw the proclamation. My education in New\nEngland, where a fast is proclaimed every year, was here of some\nadvantage: I drew it in the accustomed stile, it was translated into\nGerman, printed in both languages, and divulg'd thro' the province. This\ngave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing\ntheir congregations to join in the association, and it would probably\nhave been general among all but Quakers if the peace had not soon\ninterven'd.\n\nIt was thought by some of my friends that, by my activity in these\naffairs, I should offend that sect, and thereby lose my interest in the\nAssembly of the province, where they formed a great majority. A young\ngentleman who had likewise some friends in the House, and wished to\nsucceed me as their clerk, acquainted me that it was decided to displace\nme at the next election; and he, therefore, in good will, advis'd me to\nresign, as more consistent with my honour than being turn'd out. My\nanswer to him was, that I had read or heard of some public man who made\nit a rule never to ask for an office, and never to refuse one when\noffer'd to him. \"I approve,\" says I, \"of his rule, and will practice it\nwith a small addition; I shall never ask, never refuse, nor ever resign\nan office. If they will have my office of clerk to dispose of to\nanother, they shall take it from me. I will not, by giving it up, lose\nmy right of some time or other making reprisals on my adversaries.\" I\nheard, however, no more of this; I was chosen again unanimously as usual\nat the next election. Possibly, as they dislik'd my late intimacy with\nthe members of council, who had join'd the governors in all the disputes\nabout military preparations, with which the House had long been\nharass'd, they might have been pleas'd if I would voluntarily have left\nthem; but they did not care to displace me on account merely of my zeal\nfor the association, and they could not well give another reason.\n\nIndeed I had some cause to believe that the defense of the country was\nnot disagreeable to any of them, provided they were not requir'd to\nassist in it. And I found that a much greater number of them than I\ncould have imagined, tho' against offensive war, were clearly for the\ndefensive. Many pamphlets pro and con were publish'd on the subject, and\nsome by good Quakers, in favour of defense, which I believe convinc'd\nmost of their younger people.\n\nA transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their\nprevailing sentiments. It had been propos'd that we should encourage the\nscheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock, then\nabout sixty pounds, in tickets of the lottery. By our rules, no money\ncould be dispos'd of till the next meeting after the proposal. The\ncompany consisted of thirty members, of which twenty-two were Quakers,\nand eight only of other persuasions. We eight punctually attended the\nmeeting; but, tho' we thought that some of the Quakers would join us, we\nwere by no means sure of a majority. Only one Quaker, Mr. James Morris,\nappear'd to oppose the measure. He expressed much sorrow that it had\never been propos'd, as he said Friends were all against it, and it would\ncreate such discord as might break up the company. We told him that we\nsaw no reason for that; we were the minority, and if Friends were\nagainst the measure, and outvoted us, we must and should, agreeably to\nthe usage of all societies, submit. When the hour for business arriv'd\nit was mov'd to put the vote; he allow'd we might then do it by the\nrules, but, as he could assure us that a number of members intended to\nbe present for the purpose of opposing it, it would be but candid to\nallow a little time for their appearing.\n\nWhile we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen\nbelow desir'd to speak with me. I went down, and found they were two of\nour Quaker members. They told me there were eight of them assembled at a\ntavern just by; that they were determin'd to come and vote with us if\nthere should be occasion, which they hop'd would not be the case, and\ndesir'd we would not call for their assistance if we could do without\nit, as their voting for such a measure might embroil them with their\nelders and friends. Being thus secure of a majority, I went up, and\nafter a little seeming hesitation, agreed to a delay of another hour.\nThis Mr. Morris allow'd to be extreamly fair. Not one of his opposing\nfriends appear'd, at which he express'd great surprize; and, at the\nexpiration of the hour, we carry'd the resolution eight to one; and as,\nof the twenty-two Quakers, eight were ready to vote with us, and\nthirteen, by their absence, manifested that they were not inclin'd to\noppose the measure, I afterward estimated the proportion of Quakers\nsincerely against defense as one to twenty-one only; for these were all\nregular members of that society, and in good reputation among them, and\nhad due notice of what was propos'd at that meeting.\n\nThe honorable and learned Mr. Logan, who had always been of that sect,\nwas one who wrote an address to them, declaring his approbation of\ndefensive war, and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments. He\nput into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for the\nbattery, with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn wholly to\nthat service. He told me the following anecdote of his old master,\nWilliam Penn, respecting defense. He came over from England, when a\nyoung man, with that proprietary, and as his secretary. It was war-time,\nand their ship was chas'd by an armed vessel, suppos'd to be an enemy.\nTheir captain prepar'd for defense; but told William Penn, and his\ncompany of Quakers, that he did not expect their assistance, and they\nmight retire into the cabin, which they did, except James Logan, who\nchose to stay upon deck, and was quarter'd to a gun. The suppos'd enemy\nprov'd a friend, so there was no fighting; but when the secretary went\ndown to communicate the intelligence, William Penn rebuk'd him severely\nfor staying upon deck, and undertaking to assist in defending the\nvessel, contrary to the principles of Friends, especially as it had not\nbeen required by the captain. This reproof, being before all the\ncompany, piqu'd the secretary, who answer'd, \"I being thy servant, why\ndid thee not order me to come down? But thee was willing enough that I\nshould stay and help to fight the ship when thee thought there was\ndanger.\"\n\nMy being many years in the Assembly, the majority of which were\nconstantly Quakers, gave me frequent opportunities of seeing the\nembarrassment given them by their principle against war, whenever\napplication was made to them, by order of the crown, to grant aids for\nmilitary purposes. They were unwilling to offend government, on the one\nhand, by a direct refusal; and their friends, the body of the Quakers,\non the other, by a compliance contrary to their principles; hence a\nvariety of evasions to avoid complying, and modes of disguising the\ncompliance when it became unavoidable. The common mode at last was, to\ngrant money under the phrase of its being \"for the king's use,\" and\nnever to inquire how it was applied."

        "content": "But, if the demand was not directly from the crown, that phrase was\nfound not so proper, and some other was to be invented. As, when powder\nwas wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg), and the\ngovernment of New England solicited a grant of some from Pennsilvania,\nwhich was much urg'd on the House by Governor Thomas, they could not\ngrant money to buy powder, because that was an ingredient of war; but\nthey voted an aid to New England of three thousand pounds, to be put\ninto the hands of the governor, and appropriated it for the purchasing\nof bread, flour, wheat, or other grain. Some of the council, desirous of\ngiving the House still further embarrassment, advis'd the governor not\nto accept provision, as not being the thing he had demanded; but be\nreply'd, \"I shall take the money, for I understand very well their\nmeaning; other grain is gunpowder,\" which he accordingly bought, and\nthey never objected to it. [10]\n\n[10] See the votes.--[Marg. note.]\n\nIt was in allusion to this fact that, when in our fire company we feared\nthe success of our proposal in favour of the lottery, and I had said to\nmy friend Mr. Syng, one of our members, \"If we fail, let us move the\npurchase of a fire-engine with the money; the Quakers can have no\nobjection to that; and then, if you nominate me and I you as a committee\nfor that purpose, we will buy a great gun, which is certainly a\nfire-engine.\" \"I see,\" says he, \"you have improv'd by being so long in\nthe Assembly; your equivocal project would be just a match for their\nwheat or other grain.\"\n\nThese embarrassments that the Quakers suffer'd from having establish'd\nand published it as one of their principles that no kind of war was\nlawful, and which, being once published, they could not afterwards,\nhowever they might change their minds, easily get rid of, reminds me of\nwhat I think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us, that of\nthe Dunkers. I was acquainted with one of its founders, Michael Welfare,\nsoon after it appear'd. He complain'd to me that they were grievously\ncalumniated by the zealots of other persuasions, and charg'd with\nabominable principles and practices, to which they were utter strangers.\nI told him this had always been the case with new sects, and that, to\nput a stop to such abuse, I imagin'd it might be well to publish the\narticles of their belief, and the rules of their discipline. He said\nthat it had been propos'd among them, but not agreed to, for this\nreason: \"When we were first drawn together as a society,\" says he, \"it\nhad pleased God to enlighten our minds so far as to see that some\ndoctrines, which we once esteemed truths, were errors; and that others,\nwhich we had esteemed errors, were real truths. From time to time He has\nbeen pleased to afford us farther light, and our principles have been\nimproving, and our errors diminishing. Now we are not sure that we are\narrived at the end of this progression, and at the perfection of\nspiritual or theological knowledge; and we fear that, if we should once\nprint our confession of faith, we should feel ourselves as if bound and\nconfin'd by it, and perhaps be unwilling to receive farther improvement,\nand our successors still more so, as conceiving what we their elders and\nfounders had done, to be something sacred, never to be departed from.\"\n\nThis modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history of\nmankind, every other sect supposing itself in possession of all truth,\nand that those who differ are so far in the wrong; like a man traveling\nin foggy weather, those at some distance before him on the road he sees\nwrapped up in the fog, as well as those behind him, and also the people\nin the fields on each side, but near him all appears clear, tho' in\ntruth he is as much in the fog as any of them. To avoid this kind of\nembarrassment, the Quakers have of late years been gradually declining\nthe public service in the Assembly and in the magistracy, choosing\nrather to quit their power than their principle.\n\nIn order of time, I should have mentioned before, that having, in 1742,\ninvented an open stove for the better warming of rooms, and at the same\ntime saving fuel, as the fresh air admitted was warmed in entering, I\nmade a present of the model to Mr. Robert Grace, one of my early\nfriends, who, having an iron-furnace, found the casting of the plates\nfor these stoves a profitable thing, as they were growing in demand. To\npromote that demand, I wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled \"An\nAccount of the new-invented Pennsylvania Fireplaces; wherein their\nConstruction and Manner of Operation is particularly explained; their\nAdvantages above every other Method of warming Rooms demonstrated; and\nall Objections that have been raised against the Use of them answered\nand obviated,\" etc. This pamphlet had a good effect. Gov'r. Thomas was\nso pleas'd with the construction of this stove, as described in it, that\nhe offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them for a term\nof years; but I declin'd it from a principle which has ever weighed with\nme on such occasions, viz., That, as we enjoy great advantages from the\ninventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve\nothers by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and\ngenerously.\n\nAn ironmonger in London however, assuming a good deal of my pamphlet,\nand working it up into his own, and making some small changes in the\nmachine, which rather hurt its operation, got a patent for it there, and\nmade, as I was told, a little fortune by it. And this is not the only\ninstance of patents taken out for my inventions by others, tho' not\nalways with the same success, which I never contested, as having no\ndesire of profiting by patents myself, and hating disputes. The use of\nthese fireplaces in very many houses, both of this and the neighbouring\ncolonies, has been, and is, a great saving of wood to the inhabitants.\n\nPeace being concluded, and the association business therefore at an end,\nI turn'd my thoughts again to the affair of establishing an academy. The\nfirst step I took was to associate in the design a number of active\nfriends, of whom the Junto furnished a good part; the next was to write\nand publish a pamphlet, entitled Proposals Relating to the Education of\nYouth in Pennsylvania. This I distributed among the principal\ninhabitants gratis; and as soon as I could suppose their minds a little\nprepared by the perusal of it, I set on foot a subscription for opening\nand supporting an academy; it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five\nyears; by so dividing it, I judg'd the subscription might be larger, and\nI believe it was so, amounting to no less, if I remember right, than\nfive thousand pounds.\n\nIn the introduction to these proposals, I stated their publication, not\nas an act of mine, but of some publick-spirited gentlemen, avoiding as\nmuch as I could, according to my usual rule, the presenting myself to\nthe publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit.\n\nThe subscribers, to carry the project into immediate execution, chose\nout of their number twenty-four trustees, and appointed Mr. Francis,\nthen attorney-general, and myself to draw up constitutions for the\ngovernment of the academy; which being done and signed, a house was\nhired, masters engag'd, and the schools opened, I think, in the same\nyear, 1749.\n\nThe scholars increasing fast, the house was soon found too small, and we\nwere looking out for a piece of ground, properly situated, with\nintention to build, when Providence threw into our way a large house\nready built, which, with a few alterations, might well serve our\npurpose. This was the building before mentioned, erected by the hearers\nof Mr. Whitefield, and was obtained for us in the following manner."

        "content": "It is to be noted that the contributions to this building being made by\npeople of different sects, care was taken in the nomination of trustees,\nin whom the building and ground was to be vested, that a predominancy\nshould not be given to any sect, lest in time that predominancy might be\na means of appropriating the whole to the use of such sect, contrary to\nthe original intention. It was therefore that one of each sect was\nappointed, viz., one Church-of-England man, one Presbyterian, one\nBaptist, one Moravian, etc., those, in case of vacancy by death, were to\nfill it by election from among the contributors. The Moravian happen'd\nnot to please his colleagues, and on his death they resolved to have no\nother of that sect. The difficulty then was, how to avoid having two of\nsome other sect, by means of the new choice.\n\nSeveral persons were named, and for that reason not agreed to. At length\none mention'd me, with the observation that I was merely an honest man,\nand of no sect at all, which prevail'd with them to chuse me. The\nenthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long since abated,\nand its trustees had not been able to procure fresh contributions for\npaying the ground-rent, and discharging some other debts the building\nhad occasion'd, which embarrass'd them greatly. Being now a member of\nboth setts of trustees, that for the building and that for the Academy,\nI had a good opportunity of negotiating with both, and brought them\nfinally to an agreement, by which the trustees for the building were to\ncede it to those of the academy, the latter undertaking to discharge the\ndebt, to keep for ever open in the building a large hall for occasional\npreachers, according to the original intention, and maintain a\nfree-school for the instruction of poor children. Writings were\naccordingly drawn, and on paying the debts the trustees of the academy\nwere put in possession of the premises; and by dividing the great and\nlofty hall into stories, and different rooms above and below for the\nseveral schools, and purchasing some additional ground, the whole was\nsoon made fit for our purpose, and the scholars remov'd into the\nbuilding. The care and trouble of agreeing with the workmen, purchasing\nmaterials, and superintending the work, fell upon me; and I went thro'\nit the more cheerfully, as it did not then interfere with my private\nbusiness, having the year before taken a very able, industrious, and\nhonest partner, Mr. David Hall, with whose character I was well\nacquainted, as he had work'd for me four years. He took off my hands all\ncare of the printing-office, paying me punctually my share of the\nprofits. This partnership continued eighteen years, successfully for us\nboth.\n\nThe trustees of the academy, after a while, were incorporated by a\ncharter from the governor; their funds were increas'd by contributions\nin Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries, to which the\nAssembly has since made considerable addition; and thus was established\nthe present University of Philadelphia. I have been continued one of its\ntrustees from the beginning, now near forty years, and have had the very\ngreat pleasure of seeing a number of the youth who have receiv'd their\neducation in it, distinguish'd by their improv'd abilities, serviceable\nin public stations, and ornaments to their country.\n\nWhen I disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from private business, I\nflatter'd myself that, by the sufficient tho' moderate fortune I had\nacquir'd, I had secured leisure during the rest of my life for\nphilosophical studies and amusements. I purchased all Dr. Spence's\napparatus, who had come from England to lecture here, and I proceeded in\nmy electrical experiments with great alacrity; but the publick, now\nconsidering me as a man of leisure, laid hold of me for their purposes,\nevery part of our civil government, and almost at the same time,\nimposing some duty upon me. The governor put me into the commission of\nthe peace; the corporation of the city chose me of the common council,\nand soon after an alderman; and the citizens at large chose me a burgess\nto represent them in Assembly. This latter station was the more\nagreeable to me, as I was at length tired with sitting there to hear\ndebates, in which, as clerk, I could take no part, and which were often\nso unentertaining that I was induc'd to amuse myself with making magic\nsquares or circles, or any thing to avoid weariness; and I conceiv'd my\nbecoming a member would enlarge my power of doing good. I would not,\nhowever, insinuate that my ambition was not flatter'd by all these\npromotions; it certainly was; for, considering my low beginning, they\nwere great things to me; and they were still more pleasing, as being so\nmany spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion, and by me\nentirely unsolicited.\n\nThe office of justice of the peace I try'd a little, by attending a few\ncourts, and sitting on the bench to hear causes; but finding that more\nknowledge of the common law than I possess'd was necessary to act in\nthat station with credit, I gradually withdrew from it, excusing myself\nby my being oblig'd to attend the higher duties of a legislator in the\nAssembly. My election to this trust was repeated every year for ten\nyears, without my ever asking any elector for his vote, or signifying,\neither directly or indirectly, any desire of being chosen. On taking my\nseat in the House, my son was appointed their clerk.\n\nThe year following, a treaty being to be held with the Indians at\nCarlisle, the governor sent a message to the House, proposing that they\nshould nominate some of their members, to be join'd with some members of\ncouncil, as commissioners for that purpose. [11] The House named the\nspeaker (Mr. Norris) and myself; and, being commission'd, we went to\nCarlisle, and met the Indians accordingly.\n\n[11] See the votes to have this more correctly.--[Marg. note.]\n\nAs those people are extreamly apt to get drunk, and, when so, are very\nquarrelsome and disorderly, we strictly forbad the selling any liquor to\nthem; and when they complain'd of this restriction, we told them that if\nthey would continue sober during the treaty, we would give them plenty\nof rum when business was over. They promis'd this, and they kept their\npromise, because they could get no liquor, and the treaty was conducted\nvery orderly, and concluded to mutual satisfaction. They then claim'd\nand receiv'd the rum; this was in the afternoon; they were near one\nhundred men, women, and children, and were lodg'd in temporary cabins,\nbuilt in the form of a square, just without the town. In the evening,\nhearing a great noise among them, the commissioners walk'd out to see\nwhat was the matter. We found they had made a great bonfire in the\nmiddle of the square; they were all drunk, men and women, quarreling and\nfighting. Their dark-colour'd bodies, half naked, seen only by the\ngloomy light of the bonfire, running after and beating one another with\nfirebrands, accompanied by their horrid yellings, form'd a scene the\nmost resembling our ideas of hell that could well be imagin'd; there was\nno appeasing the tumult, and we retired to our lodging. At midnight a\nnumber of them came thundering at our door, demanding more rum, of which\nwe took no notice."

        "content": "The next day, sensible they had misbehav'd in giving us that\ndisturbance, they sent three of their old counselors to make their\napology. The orator acknowledg'd the fault, but laid it upon the rum;\nand then endeavored to excuse the rum by saying, \"The Great Spirit, who\nmade all things, made every thing for some use, and whatever use he\ndesign'd any thing for, that use it should always be put to. Now, when\nhe made rum, he said 'Let this be for the Indians to get drunk with,'\nand it must be so.\" And, indeed, if it be the design of Providence to\nextirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the\nearth, it seems not improbable that rum may be the appointed means. It\nhas already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the\nsea-coast.\n\nIn 1751, Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine, conceived the\nidea of establishing a hospital in Philadelphia (a very beneficent\ndesign, which has been ascrib'd to me, but was originally his), for the\nreception and cure of poor sick persons, whether inhabitants of the\nprovince or strangers. He was zealous and active in endeavouring to\nprocure subscriptions for it, but the proposal being a novelty in\nAmerica, and at first not well understood, he met but with small\nsuccess.\n\nAt length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was no\nsuch thing as carrying a public-spirited project through without my\nbeing concern'd in it. \"For,\" says he, \"I am often ask'd by those to\nwhom I propose subscribing, Have you consulted Franklin upon this\nbusiness? And what does he think of it? And when I tell them that I have\nnot (supposing it rather out of your line), they do not subscribe, but\nsay they will consider of it.\" I enquired into the nature and probable\nutility of his scheme, and receiving from him a very satisfactory\nexplanation, I not only subscrib'd to it myself, but engag'd heartily in\nthe design of procuring subscriptions from others. Previously, however,\nto the solicitation, I endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people by\nwriting on the subject in the newspapers, which was my usual custom in\nsuch cases, but which he had omitted.\n\nThe subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous; but, beginning\nto flag, I saw they would be insufficient without some assistance from\nthe Assembly, and therefore propos'd to petition for it, which was done.\nThe country members did not at first relish the project; they objected\nthat it could only be serviceable to the city, and therefore the\ncitizens alone should be at the expense of it; and they doubted whether\nthe citizens themselves generally approv'd of it. My allegation on the\ncontrary, that it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of our\nbeing able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations, they\nconsidered as a most extravagant supposition, and utterly impossible.\n\nOn this I form'd my plan; and asking leave to bring in a bill for\nincorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their\npetition, and granting them a blank sum of money, which leave was\nobtained chiefly on the consideration that the House could throw the\nbill out if they did not like it, I drew it so as to make the important\nclause a conditional one, viz., \"And be it enacted, by the authority\naforesaid, that when the said contributors shall have met and chosen\ntheir managers and treasurer, and shall have raised by their\ncontributions a capital stock of ------ value (the yearly interest of\nwhich is to be applied to the accommodating of the sick poor in the said\nhospital, free of charge for diet, attendance, advice, and medicines),\nand shall make the same appear to the satisfaction of the speaker of the\nAssembly for the time being, that then it shall and may be lawful for\nthe said speaker, and he is hereby required, to sign an order on the\nprovincial treasurer for the payment of two thousand pounds, in two\nyearly payments, to the treasurer of the said hospital, to be applied to\nthe founding, building, and finishing of the same.\"\n\nThis condition carried the bill through; for the members, who had\noppos'd the grant, and now conceiv'd they might have the credit of being\ncharitable without the expence, agreed to its passage; and then, in\nsoliciting subscriptions among the people, we urg'd the conditional\npromise of the law as an additional motive to give, since every man's\ndonation would be doubled; thus the clause work'd both ways. The\nsubscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum, and we\nclaim'd and receiv'd the public gift, which enabled us to carry the\ndesign into execution. A convenient and handsome building was soon\nerected; the institution has by constant experience been found useful,\nand flourishes to this day; and I do not remember any of my political\nmanœuvres, the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure, or\nwherein, after thinking of it, I more easily excus'd myself for having\nmade some use of cunning.\n\nIt was about this time that another projector, the Rev. Gilbert Tennent,\ncame to me with a request that I would assist him in procuring a\nsubscription for erecting a new meeting-house. It was to be for the use\nof a congregation he had gathered among the Presbyterians, who were\noriginally disciples of Mr. Whitefield. Unwilling to make myself\ndisagreeable to my fellow-citizens by too frequently soliciting their\ncontributions, I absolutely refus'd. He then desired I would furnish him\nwith a list of the names of persons I knew by experience to be generous\nand public-spirited. I thought it would be unbecoming in me, after their\nkind compliance with my solicitations, to mark them out to be worried by\nother beggars, and therefore refus'd also to give such a list. He then\ndesir'd I would at least give him my advice. \"That I will readily do,\"\nsaid I; \"and, in the first place, I advise you to apply to all those\nwhom you know will give something; next, to those whom you are uncertain\nwhether they will give any thing or not, and show them the list of those\nwho have given; and, lastly, do not neglect those who you are sure will\ngive nothing, for in some of them you may be mistaken.\" He laugh'd and\nthank'd me, and said he would take my advice. He did so, for he ask'd of\neverybody, and he obtained a much larger sum than he expected, with\nwhich he erected the capacious and very elegant meeting-house that\nstands in Arch-street.\n\nOur city, tho' laid out with a beautiful regularity, the streets large,\nstrait, and crossing each other at right angles, had the disgrace of\nsuffering those streets to remain long unpav'd, and in wet weather the\nwheels of heavy carriages plough'd them into a quagmire, so that it was\ndifficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dust was offensive. I\nhad liv'd near what was call'd the Jersey Market, and saw with pain the\ninhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions. A strip of\nground down the middle of that market was at length pav'd with brick, so\nthat, being once in the market, they had firm footing, but were often\nover shoes in dirt to get there. By talking and writing on the subject,\nI was at length instrumental in getting the street pav'd with stone\nbetween the market and the brick'd foot-pavement, that was on each side\nnext the houses. This, for some time, gave an easy access to the market\ndry-shod; but, the rest of the street not being pav'd, whenever a\ncarriage came out of the mud upon this pavement, it shook off and left\nits dirt upon it, and it was soon cover'd with mire, which was not\nremov'd, the city as yet having no scavengers."

        "content": "After some inquiry I found a poor industrious man, who was willing to\nundertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twice a week,\ncarrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours' doors, for the sum\nof sixpence per month, to be paid by each house. I then wrote and\nprinted a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that\nmight be obtain'd by this small expense; the greater ease in keeping our\nhouses clean, so much dirt not being brought in by people's feet; the\nbenefit to the shops by more custom, etc., etc., as buyers could more\neasily get at them; and by not having, in windy weather, the dust blown\nin upon their goods, etc., etc. I sent one of these papers to each\nhouse, and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe an\nagreement to pay these sixpences; it was unanimously sign'd, and for a\ntime well executed. All the inhabitants of the city were delighted with\nthe cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market, it being a\nconvenience to all, and this rais'd a general desire to have all the\nstreets paved, and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for\nthat purpose.\n\nAfter some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and brought it into\nthe Assembly. It was just before I went to England, in 1757, and did not\npass till I was gone, [12] and then with an alteration in the mode of\nassessment, which I thought not for the better, but with an additional\nprovision for lighting as well as paving the streets, which was a great\nimprovement. It was by a private person, the late Mr. John Clifton, his\ngiving a sample of the utility of lamps, by placing one at his door,\nthat the people were first impress'd with the idea of enlighting all the\ncity. The honour of this public benefit has also been ascrib'd to me,\nbut it belongs truly to that gentleman. I did but follow his example,\nand have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps, as\ndiffering from the globe lamps we were at first supply'd with from\nLondon. Those we found inconvenient in these respects: they admitted no\nair below; the smoke, therefore, did not readily go out above, but\ncirculated in the globe, lodg'd on its inside, and soon obstructed the\nlight they were intended to afford; giving, besides, the daily trouble\nof wiping them clean; and an accidental stroke on one of them would\ndemolish it, and render it totally useless. I therefore suggested the\ncomposing them of four flat panes, with a long funnel above to draw up\nthe smoke, and crevices admitting air below, to facilitate the ascent of\nthe smoke; by this means they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in\na few hours, as the London lamps do, but continu'd bright till morning,\nand an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane, easily\nrepair'd.\n\n[12] See votes.\n\nI have sometimes wonder'd that the Londoners did not, from the effect\nholes in the bottom of the globe lamps us'd at Vauxhall have in keeping\nthem clean, learn to have such holes in their street lamps. But, these\nholes being made for another purpose, viz., to communicate flame more\nsuddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro' them, the other\nuse, of letting in air, seems not to have been thought of; and\ntherefore, after the lamps have been lit a few hours, the streets of\nLondon are very poorly illuminated.\n\nThe mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I propos'd,\nwhen in London, to Dr. Fothergill, who was among the best men I have\nknown, and a great promoter of useful projects. I had observ'd that the\nstreets, when dry, were never swept, and the light dust carried away;\nbut it was suffer'd to accumulate till wet weather reduc'd it to mud,\nand then, after lying some days so deep on the pavement that there was\nno crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms, it was\nwith great labour rak'd together and thrown up into carts open above,\nthe sides of which suffer'd some of the slush at every jolt on the\npavement to shake out and fall, sometimes to the annoyance of\nfoot-passengers. The reason given for not sweeping the dusty streets\nwas, that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses.\n\nAn accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be\ndone in a little time. I found at my door in Craven-street, one morning,\na poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom; she appeared very\npale and feeble, as just come out of a fit of sickness. I ask'd who\nemploy'd her to sweep there; she said, \"Nobody, but I am very poor and\nin distress, and I sweeps before gentlefolkses doors, and hopes they\nwill give me something.\" I bid her sweep the whole street clean, and I\nwould give her a shilling; this was at nine o'clock; at 12 she came for\nthe shilling. From the slowness I saw at first in her working, I could\nscarce believe that the work was done so soon, and sent my servant to\nexamine it, who reported that the whole street was swept perfectly\nclean, and all the dust plac'd in the gutter, which was in the middle;\nand the next rain wash'd it quite away, so that the pavement and even\nthe kennel were perfectly clean.\n\nI then judg'd that, if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in\nthree hours, a strong, active man might have done it in half the time.\nAnd here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in such\na narrow street, running down its middle, instead of two, one on each\nside, near the footway; for where all the rain that falls on a street\nruns from the sides and meets in the middle, it forms there a current\nstrong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with; but when divided\ninto two channels, it is often too weak to cleanse either, and only\nmakes the mud it finds more fluid, so that the wheels of carriages and\nfeet of horses throw and dash it upon the foot-pavement, which is\nthereby rendered foul and slippery, and sometimes splash it upon those\nwho are walking. My proposal, communicated to the good doctor, was as\nfollows:\n\n\"For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets of London\nand Westminster, it is proposed that the several watchmen be contracted\nwith to have the dust swept up in dry seasons, and the mud rak'd up at\nother times, each in the several streets and lanes of his round; that\nthey be furnish'd with brooms and other proper instruments for these\npurposes, to be kept at their respective stands, ready to furnish the\npoor people they may employ in the service.\n\n\"That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps at\nproper distances, before the shops and windows of houses are usually\nopened, when the scavengers, with close-covered carts, shall also carry\nit all away.\n\n\"That the mud, when rak'd up, be not left in heaps to be spread abroad\nagain by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses, but that the\nscavengers be provided with bodies of carts, not plac'd high upon\nwheels, but low upon sliders, with lattice bottoms, which, being cover'd\nwith straw, will retain the mud thrown into them, and permit the water\nto drain from it, whereby it will become much lighter, water making the\ngreatest part of its weight; these bodies of carts to be plac'd at\nconvenient distances, and the mud brought to them in wheel-barrows; they\nremaining where plac'd till the mud is drain'd, and then horses brought\nto draw them away.\""

        "content": "I have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of this\nproposal, on account of the narrowness of some streets, and the\ndifficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as not to encumber too much\nthe passage; but I am still of opinion that the former, requiring the\ndust to be swept up and carry'd away before the shops are open, is very\npracticable in the summer, when the days are long; for, in walking thro'\nthe Strand and Fleet-street one morning at seven o'clock, I observ'd\nthere was not one shop open, tho' it had been daylight and the sun up\nabove three hours; the inhabitants of London chusing voluntarily to live\nmuch by candle-light, and sleep by sunshine, and yet often complain, a\nlittle absurdly, of the duty on candles and the high price of tallow.\n\nSome may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating; but\nwhen they consider that tho' dust blown into the eyes of a single\nperson, or into a single shop on a windy day, is but of small\nimportance, yet the great number of the instances in a populous city,\nand its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence, perhaps\nthey will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to\naffairs of this seemingly low nature. Human felicity is produc'd not so\nmuch by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little\nadvantages that occur every day. Thus, if you teach a poor young man to\nshave himself, and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to\nthe happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas. The\nmoney may be soon spent, the regret only remaining of having foolishly\nconsumed it; but in the other case, he escapes the frequent vexation of\nwaiting for barbers, and of their sometimes dirty fingers, offensive\nbreaths, and dull razors; he shaves when most convenient to him, and\nenjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument. With\nthese sentiments I have hazarded the few preceding pages, hoping they\nmay afford hints which some time or other may be useful to a city I\nlove, having lived many years in it very happily, and perhaps to some of\nour towns in America.\n\nHaving been for some time employed by the postmaster-general of America\nas his comptroller in regulating several offices, and bringing the\nofficers to account, I was, upon his death in 1753, appointed, jointly\nwith Mr. William Hunter, to succeed him, by a commission from the\npostmaster-general in England. The American office never had hitherto\npaid any thing to that of Britain. We were to have six hundred pounds a\nyear between us, if we could make that sum out of the profits of the\noffice. To do this, a variety of improvements were necessary; some of\nthese were inevitably at first expensive, so that in the first four\nyears the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us. But it\nsoon after began to repay us; and before I was displac'd by a freak of\nthe ministers, of which I shall speak hereafter, we had brought it to\nyield three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the postoffice\nof Ireland. Since that imprudent transaction, they have receiv'd from\nit--not one farthing!\n\nThe business of the postoffice occasion'd my taking a journey this year\nto New England, where the College of Cambridge, of their own motion,\npresented me with the degree of Master of Arts. Yale College, in\nConnecticut, had before made me a similar compliment. Thus, without\nstudying in any college, I came to partake of their honours. They were\nconferr'd in consideration of my improvements and discoveries in the\nelectric branch of natural philosophy.\n\nIn 1754, war with France being again apprehended, a congress of\ncommissioners from the different colonies was, by an order of the Lords\nof Trade, to be assembled at Albany, there to confer with the chiefs of\nthe Six Nations concerning the means of defending both their country and\nours. Governor Hamilton, having receiv'd this order, acquainted the\nHouse with it, requesting they would furnish proper presents for the\nIndians, to be given on this occasion; and naming the speaker (Mr.\nNorris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr. Secretary Peters as\ncommissioners to act for Pennsylvania. The House approv'd the\nnomination, and provided the goods for the present, and tho' they did\nnot much like treating out of the provinces; and we met the other\ncommissioners at Albany about the middle of June.\n\nIn our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the union of all the\ncolonies under one government, so far as might be necessary for defense,\nand other important general purposes. As we pass'd thro' New York, I had\nthere shown my project to Mr. James Alexander and Mr. Kennedy, two\ngentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs, and, being fortified by\ntheir approbation, I ventur'd to lay it before the Congress. It then\nappeared that several of the commissioners had form'd plans of the same\nkind. A previous question was first taken, whether a union should be\nestablished, which pass'd in the affirmative unanimously. A committee\nwas then appointed, one member from each colony, to consider the several\nplans and report. Mine happen'd to be preferr'd, and, with a few\namendments, was accordingly reported.\n\nBy this plan the general government was to be administered by a\npresident-general, appointed and supported by the crown, and a grand\ncouncil was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of the\nseveral colonies, met in their respective assemblies. The debates upon\nit in Congress went on daily, hand in hand with the Indian business.\nMany objections and difficulties were started, but at length they were\nall overcome, and the plan was unanimously agreed to, and copies ordered\nto be transmitted to the Board of Trade and to the assemblies of the\nseveral provinces. Its fate was singular: the assemblies did not adopt\nit, as they all thought there was too much prerogative in it, and in\nEngland it was judg'd to have too much of the democratic.\n\nThe Board of Trade therefore did not approve of it, nor recommend it for\nthe approbation of his majesty; but another scheme was form'd, supposed\nto answer the same purpose better, whereby the governors of the\nprovinces, with some members of their respective councils, were to meet\nand order the raising of troops, building of forts, etc., and to draw on\nthe treasury of Great Britain for the expense, which was afterwards to\nbe refunded by an act of Parliament laying a tax on America. My plan,\nwith my reasons in support of it, is to be found among my political\npapers that are printed.\n\nBeing the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation with\nGovernor Shirley upon both the plans. Part of what passed between us on\nthe occasion may also be seen among those papers. The different and\ncontrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was\nreally the true medium; and I am still of opinion it would have been\nhappy for both sides the water if it had been adopted. The colonies, so\nunited, would have been sufficiently strong to have defended themselves;\nthere would then have been no need of troops from England; of course,\nthe subsequent pretence for taxing America, and the bloody contest it\noccasioned, would have been avoided. But such mistakes are not new;\nhistory is full of the errors of states and princes.\n\nLook round the habitable world, how few\n\nKnow their own good, or, knowing it, pursue!\n\nThose who govern, having much business on their hands, do not generally\nlike to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new\nprojects. The best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from\nprevious wisdom, but forc'd by the occasion."

        "content": "The Governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the Assembly,\nexpress'd his approbation of the plan, \"as appearing to him to be drawn\nup with great clearness and strength of judgment, and therefore\nrecommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious\nattention.\" The House, however, by the management of a certain member,\ntook it up when I happen'd to be absent, which I thought not very fair,\nand reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all, to my no\nsmall mortification.\n\nIn my journey to Boston this year, I met at New York with our new\ngovernor, Mr. Morris, just arriv'd there from England, with whom I had\nbeen before intimately acquainted. He brought a commission to supersede\nMr. Hamilton, who, tir'd with the disputes his proprietary instructions\nsubjected him to, had resign'd. Mr. Morris ask'd me if I thought he must\nexpect as uncomfortable an administration. I said, \"No; you may, on the\ncontrary, have a very comfortable one, if you will only take care not to\nenter into any dispute with the Assembly.\" \"My dear friend,\" says he,\npleasantly, \"how can you advise my avoiding disputes? You know I love\ndisputing; it is one of my greatest pleasures; however, to show the\nregard I have for your counsel, I promise you I will, if possible, avoid\nthem.\" He had some reason for loving to dispute, being eloquent, an\nacute sophister, and, therefore, generally successful in argumentative\nconversation. He had been brought up to it from a boy, his father, as I\nhave heard, accustoming his children to dispute with one another for his\ndiversion, while sitting at table after dinner; but I think the practice\nwas not wise; for, in the course of my observation, these disputing,\ncontradicting, and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their\naffairs. They get victory sometimes, but they never get good will, which\nwould be of more use to them. We parted, he going to Philadelphia, and I\nto Boston.\n\nIn returning, I met at New York with the votes of the Assembly, by which\nit appear'd that, notwithstanding his promise to me, he and the House\nwere already in high contention; and it was a continual battle between\nthem as long as he retain'd the government. I had my share of it; for,\nas soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly, I was put on every\ncommittee for answering his speeches and messages, and by the committees\nalways desired to make the drafts. Our answers, as well as his messages,\nwere often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive; and, as he knew I\nwrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined that, when we met, we\ncould hardly avoid cutting throats; but he was so good-natur'd a man\nthat no personal difference between him and me was occasion'd by the\ncontest, and we often din'd together.\n\nOne afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in the\nstreet. \"Franklin,\" says he, \"you must go home with me and spend the\nevening; I am to have some company that you will like;\" and, taking me\nby the arm, he led me to his house. In gay conversation over our wine,\nafter supper, he told us, jokingly, that he much admir'd the idea of\nSancho Panza, who, when it was proposed to give him a government,\nrequested it might be a government of blacks, as then, if he could not\nagree with his people, he might sell them. One of his friends, who sat\nnext to me, says, \"Franklin, why do you continue to side with these\ndamn'd Quakers? Had not you better sell them? The proprietor would give\nyou a good price.\" \"The governor,\" says I, \"has not yet blacked them\nenough.\" He, indeed, had labored hard to blacken the Assembly in all his\nmessages, but they wip'd off his coloring as fast as he laid it on, and\nplac'd it, in return, thick upon his own face; so that, finding he was\nlikely to be negrofied himself, he, as well as Mr. Hamilton, grew tir'd\nof the contest, and quitted the government.\n\n[13] These public quarrels were all at bottom owing to the\nproprietaries, our hereditary governors, who, when any expense was to be\nincurred for the defense of their province, with incredible meanness\ninstructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary\ntaxes, unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly excused;\nand they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observe such\ninstructions. The Assemblies for three years held out against this\ninjustice, tho' constrained to bend at last. At length Captain Denny,\nwho was Governor Morris's successor, ventured to disobey those\ninstructions; how that was brought about I shall show hereafter.\n\n[13] My acts in Morris's time, military, etc.--[Marg. note.]\n\nBut I am got forward too fast with my story: there are still some\ntransactions to be mention'd that happened during the administration of\nGovernor Morris.\n\nWar being in a manner commenced with France, the government of\nMassachusetts Bay projected an attack upon Crown Point, and sent Mr.\nQuincy to Pennsylvania, and Mr. Pownall, afterward Governor Pownall, to\nNew York, to solicit assistance. As I was in the Assembly, knew its\ntemper, and was Mr. Quincy's countryman, he appli'd to me for my\ninfluence and assistance. I dictated his address to them, which was well\nreceiv'd. They voted an aid of ten thousand pounds, to be laid out in\nprovisions. But the governor refusing his assent to their bill (which\nincluded this with other sums granted for the use of the crown), unless\na clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate from bearing any\npart of the tax that would be necessary, the Assembly, tho' very\ndesirous of making their grant to New England effectual, were at a loss\nhow to accomplish it. Mr. Quincy labored hard with the governor to\nobtain his assent, but he was obstinate.\n\nI then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor, by\norders on the trustees of the Loan Office, which, by law, the Assembly\nhad the right of drawing. There was, indeed, little or no money at that\ntime in the office, and therefore I propos'd that the orders should be\npayable in a year, and to bear an interest of five per cent. With these\norders I suppos'd the provisions might easily be purchas'd. The\nAssembly, with very little hesitation, adopted the proposal. The orders\nwere immediately printed, and I was one of the committee directed to\nsign and dispose of them. The fund for paying them was the interest of\nall the paper currency then extant in the province upon loan, together\nwith the revenue arising from the excise, which being known to be more\nthan sufficient, they obtain'd instant credit, and were not only\nreceiv'd in payment for the provisions, but many money'd people, who had\ncash lying by them, vested it in those orders, which they found\nadvantageous, as they bore interest while upon hand, and might on any\noccasion be used as money; so that they were eagerly all bought up, and\nin a few weeks none of them were to be seen. Thus this important affair\nwas by my means compleated. My Quincy return'd thanks to the Assembly in\na handsome memorial, went home highly pleas'd with the success of his\nembassy, and ever after bore for me the most cordial and affectionate\nfriendship."

He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia, and thence march'd\nto Frederictown, in Maryland, where he halted for carriages. Our\nAssembly apprehending, from some information, that he had conceived\nviolent prejudices against them, as averse to the service, wish'd me to\nwait upon him, not as from them, but as postmaster-general, under the\nguise of proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting with most\ncelerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors of\nthe several provinces, with whom he must necessarily have continual\ncorrespondence, and of which they propos'd to pay the expense. My son\naccompanied me on this journey.\n\nWe found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently for the return\nof those he had sent thro' the back parts of Maryland and Virginia to\ncollect waggons. I stayed with him several days, din'd with him daily,\nand had full opportunity of removing all his prejudices, by the\ninformation of what the Assembly had before his arrival actually done,\nand were still willing to do, to facilitate his operations. When I was\nabout to depart, the returns of waggons to be obtained were brought in,\nby which it appear'd that they amounted only to twenty-five, and not all\nof those were in serviceable condition. The general and all the officers\nwere surpris'd, declar'd the expedition was then at an end, being\nimpossible, and exclaim'd against the ministers for ignorantly landing\nthem in a country destitute of the means of conveying their stores,\nbaggage, etc., not less than one hundred and fifty waggons being\nnecessary.\n\nI happened to say I thought it was a pity they had not been landed\nrather in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost every farmer had his\nwaggon. The general eagerly laid hold of my words, and said, \"Then you,\nsir, who are a man of interest there, can probably procure them for us;\nand I beg you will undertake it.\" I ask'd what terms were to be offer'd\nthe owners of the waggons; and I was desir'd to put on paper the terms\nthat appeared to me necessary. This I did, and they were agreed to, and\na commission and instructions accordingly prepar'd immediately. What\nthose terms were will appear in the advertisement I publish'd as soon as\nI arriv'd at Lancaster, which being, from the great and sudden effect it\nproduc'd, a piece of some curiosity, I shall insert it at length, as\nfollows:\n\n\"Advertisement.\n\n\"LANCASTER, April 26, 1755.\n\n\"Whereas, one hundred and fifty waggons, with four horses to each\nwaggon, and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses, are wanted for the\nservice of his majesty's forces now about to rendezvous at Will's Creek,\nand his excellency General Braddock having been pleased to empower me to\ncontract for the hire of the same, I hereby give notice that I shall\nattend for that purpose at Lancaster from this day to next Wednesday\nevening, and at York from next Thursday morning till Friday evening,\nwhere I shall be ready to agree for waggons and teams, or single horses,\non the following terms, viz.: 1. That there shall be paid for each\nwaggon, with four good horses and a driver, fifteen shillings per diem;\nand for each able horse with a pack-saddle, or other saddle and\nfurniture, two shillings per diem; and for each able horse without a\nsaddle, eighteen pence per diem. 2. That the pay commence from the time\nof their joining the forces at Will's Creek, which must be on or before\nthe 20th of May ensuing, and that a reasonable allowance be paid over\nand above for the time necessary for their travelling to Will's Creek\nand home again after their discharge. 3. Each waggon and team, and every\nsaddle or pack horse, is to be valued by indifferent persons chosen\nbetween me and the owner; and in case of the loss of any waggon, team,\nor other horse in the service, the price according to such valuation is\nto be allowed and paid. 4. Seven days' pay is to be advanced and paid in\nhand by me to the owner of each waggon and team, or horse, at the time\nof contracting, if required, and the remainder to be paid by General\nBraddock, or by the paymaster of the army, at the time of their\ndischarge, or from time to time, as it shall be demanded. 5. No drivers\nof waggons, or persons taking care of the hired horses, are on any\naccount to be called upon to do the duty of soldiers, or be otherwise\nemployed than in conducting or taking care of their carriages or horses.\n6. All oats, Indian corn, or other forage that waggons or horses bring\nto the camp, more than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses,\nis to be taken for the use of the army, and a reasonable price paid for\nthe same.\n\n\"Note.--My son, William Franklin, is empowered to enter into like\ncontracts with any person in Cumberland county.\n\n\"B. Franklin.\"\n\n\"To the inhabitants of the Counties of Lancaster, York and Cumberland.\n\n\"Friends and Countrymen,\n\n\"Being occasionally at the camp at Frederic a few days since, I found\nthe general and officers extremely exasperated on account of their not\nbeing supplied with horses and carriages, which had been expected from\nthis province, as most able to furnish them; but, through the\ndissensions between our governor and Assembly, money had not been\nprovided, nor any steps taken for that purpose.\n\n\"It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties,\nto seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted,\nand compel as many persons into the service as would be necessary to\ndrive and take care of them.\n\n\"I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through these\ncounties on such an occasion, especially considering the temper they are\nin, and their resentment against us, would be attended with many and\ngreat inconveniences to the inhabitants, and therefore more willingly\ntook the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair and\nequitable means. The people of these back counties have lately\ncomplained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting; you\nhave an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very\nconsiderable sum; for, if the service of this expedition should\ncontinue, as it is more than probable it will, for one hundred and\ntwenty days, the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to upward\nof thirty thousand pounds, which will be paid you in silver and gold of\nthe king's money.\n\n\"The service will be light and easy, for the army will scarce march\nabove twelve miles per day, and the waggons and baggage-horses, as they\ncarry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare of the\narmy, must march with the army, and no faster; and are, for the army's\nsake, always placed where they can be most secure, whether in a march or\nin a camp.\n\n\"If you are really, as I believe you are, good and loyal subjects to his\nmajesty, you may now do a most acceptable service, and make it easy to\nyourselves; for three or four of such as can not separately spare from\nthe business of their plantations a waggon and four horses and a driver,\nmay do it together, one furnishing the waggon, another one or two\nhorses, and another the driver, and divide the pay proportionately\nbetween you; but if you do not this service to your king and country\nvoluntarily, when such good pay and reasonable terms are offered to you,\nyour loyalty will be strongly suspected. The king's business must be\ndone; so many brave troops, come so far for your defense, must not stand\nidle through your backwardness to do what may be reasonably expected\nfrom you; waggons and horses must be had; violent measures will probably\nbe used, and you will be left to seek for a recompense where you can\nfind it, and your case, perhaps, be little pitied or regarded."

If this method of obtaining the waggons and horses is not\nlikely to succeed, I am obliged to send word to the general in fourteen\ndays; and I suppose Sir John St. Clair, the hussar, with a body of\nsoldiers, will immediately enter the province for the purpose, which I\nshall be sorry to hear, because I am very sincerely and truly your\nfriend and well-wisher,\n\nB. Franklin.\"\n\nI received of the general about eight hundred pounds, to be disbursed in\nadvance-money to the waggon owners, etc.; but that sum being\ninsufficient, I advanc'd upward of two hundred pounds more, and in two\nweeks the one hundred and fifty waggons, with two hundred and fifty-nine\ncarrying horses, were on their march for the camp. The advertisement\npromised payment according to the valuation, in case any waggon or horse\nshould be lost. The owners, however, alleging they did not know General\nBraddock, or what dependence might be had on his promise, insisted on my\nbond for the performance, which I accordingly gave them.\n\nWhile I was at the camp, supping one evening with the officers of\nColonel Dunbar's regiment, he represented to me his concern for the\nsubalterns, who, he said, were generally not in affluence, and could ill\nafford, in this dear country, to lay in the stores that might be\nnecessary in so long a march, thro' a wilderness, where nothing was to\nbe purchas'd. I commiserated their case, and resolved to endeavor\nprocuring them some relief. I said nothing, however, to him of my\nintention, but wrote the next morning to the committee of the Assembly,\nwho had the disposition of some public money, warmly recommending the\ncase of these officers to their consideration, and proposing that a\npresent should be sent them of necessaries and refreshments. My son, who\nhad some experience of a camp life, and of its wants, drew up a list for\nme, which I enclos'd in my letter. The committee approv'd, and used such\ndiligence that, conducted by my son, the stores arrived at the camp as\nsoon as the waggons. They consisted of twenty parcels, each containing\n\n6 lbs. loaf sugar.            1 Gloucester cheese.\n6 lbs. good Muscovado do.     1 kegg containing 20 lbs. good butter.\n1 lb. good green tea.         2 doz. old Madeira wine.\n1 lb. good bohea do.          2 gallons Jamaica spirits.\n6 lbs. good ground coffee.    1 bottle flour of mustard.\n6 lbs. chocolate.             2 well-cur'd hams.\n1-2 cwt. best white biscuit.  1-2 dozen dry'd tongues.\n1-2 lb. pepper.               6 lbs. rice.\n1 quart best white wine       6 lbs. raisins.\nvinegar.\n\nThese twenty parcels, well pack'd, were placed on as many horses, each\nparcel, with the horse, being intended as a present for one officer.\nThey were very thankfully receiv'd, and the kindness acknowledg'd by\nletters to me from the colonels of both regiments, in the most grateful\nterms. The general, too, was highly satisfied with my conduct in\nprocuring him the waggons, etc., and readily paid my account of\ndisbursements, thanking me repeatedly, and requesting my farther\nassistance in sending provisions after him. I undertook this also, and\nwas busily employ'd in it till we heard of his defeat, advancing for the\nservice of my own money, upwards of one thousand pounds sterling, of\nwhich I sent him an account. It came to his hands, luckily for me, a few\ndays before the battle, and he return'd me immediately an order on the\npaymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds, leaving the\nremainder to the next account. I consider this payment as good luck,\nhaving never been able to obtain that remainder, of which more\nhereafter.\n\nThis general was, I think, a brave man, and might probably have made a\nfigure as a good officer in some European war. But he had too much\nself-confidence, too high an opinion of the validity of regular troops,\nand too mean a one of both Americans and Indians. George Croghan, our\nIndian interpreter, join'd him on his march with one hundred of those\npeople, who might have been of great use to his army as guides, scouts,\netc., if he had treated them kindly; but he slighted and neglected them,\nand they gradually left him.\n\nIn conversation with him one day, he was giving me some account of his\nintended progress. \"After taking Fort Duquesne,\" says he, \"I am to\nproceed to Niagara; and, having taken that, to Frontenac, if the season\nwill allow time; and I suppose it will, for Duquesne can hardly detain\nme above three or four days; and then I see nothing that can obstruct my\nmarch to Niagara.\" Having before revolv'd in my mind the long line his\narmy must make in their march by a very narrow road, to be cut for them\nthro' the woods and bushes, and also what I had read of a former defeat\nof fifteen hundred French, who invaded the Iroquois country, I had\nconceiv'd some doubts and some fears for the event of the campaign. But\nI ventur'd only to say, \"To be sure, sir, if you arrive well before\nDuquesne, with these fine troops, so well provided with artillery, that\nplace not yet compleatly fortified, and as we hear with no very strong\ngarrison, can probably make but a short resistance. The only danger I\napprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of Indians,\nwho, by constant practice, are dexterous in laying and executing them;\nand the slender line, near four miles long, which your army must make,\nmay expose it to be attack'd by surprise in its flanks, and to be cut\nlike a thread into several pieces, which, from their distance, can not\ncome up in time to support each other.\"\n\nHe smil'd at my ignorance, and reply'd, \"These savages may, indeed, be a\nformidable enemy to your raw American militia, but upon the king's\nregular and disciplin'd troops, sir, it is impossible they should make\nany impression.\" I was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with\na military man in matters of his profession, and said no more. The\nenemy, however, did not take the advantage of his army which I\napprehended its long line of march expos'd it to, but let it advance\nwithout interruption till within nine miles of the place; and then, when\nmore in a body (for it had just passed a river, where the front had\nhalted till all were come over), and in a more open part of the woods\nthan any it had pass'd, attack'd its advanced guard by a heavy fire from\nbehind trees and bushes, which was the first intelligence the general\nhad of an enemy's being near him. This guard being disordered, the\ngeneral hurried the troops up to their assistance, which was done in\ngreat confusion, thro' waggons, baggage, and cattle; and presently the\nfire came upon their flank: the officers, being on horseback, were more\neasily distinguish'd, pick'd out as marks, and fell very fast; and the\nsoldiers were crowded together in a huddle, having or hearing no orders,\nand standing to be shot at till two-thirds of them were killed; and\nthen, being seiz'd with a panick, the whole fled with precipitation."

        "content": "The waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamper'd; their\nexample was immediately followed by others; so that all the waggons,\nprovisions, artillery, and stores were left to the enemy. The general,\nbeing wounded, was brought off with difficulty; his secretary, Mr.\nShirley, was killed by his side; and out of eighty-six officers,\nsixty-three were killed or wounded, and seven hundred and fourteen men\nkilled out of eleven hundred. These eleven hundred had been picked men\nfrom the whole army; the rest had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar,\nwho was to follow with the heavier part of the stores, provisions, and\nbaggage. The flyers, not being pursu'd, arriv'd at Dunbar's camp, and\nthe panick they brought with them instantly seiz'd him and all his\npeople; and, tho' he had now above one thousand men, and the enemy who\nhad beaten Braddock did not at most exceed four hundred Indians and\nFrench together, instead of proceeding, and endeavoring to recover some\nof the lost honour, he ordered all the stores, ammunition, etc., to be\ndestroy'd, that he might have more horses to assist his flight towards\nthe settlements, and less lumber to remove. He was there met with\nrequests from the governors of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania,\nthat he would post his troops on the frontiers, so as to afford some\nprotection to the inhabitants; but he continu'd his hasty march thro'\nall the country, not thinking himself safe till he arriv'd at\nPhiladelphia, where the inhabitants could protect him. This whole\ntransaction gave us Americans the first suspicion that our exalted ideas\nof the prowess of British regulars had not been well founded.\n\nIn their first march, too, from their landing till they got beyond the\nsettlements, they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants, totally\nruining some poor families, besides insulting, abusing, and confining\nthe people if they remonstrated. This was enough to put us out of\nconceit of such defenders, if we had really wanted any. How different\nwas the conduct of our French friends in 1781, who, during a march thro'\nthe most inhabited part of our country from Rhode Island to Virginia,\nnear seven hundred miles, occasioned not the smallest complaint for the\nloss of a pig, a chicken, or even an apple.\n\nCaptain Orme, who was one of the general's aids-de-camp, and, being\ngrievously wounded, was brought off with him, and continu'd with him to\nhis death, which happen'd in a few days, told me that he was totally\nsilent all the first day, and at night only said, \"Who would have\nthought it?\" That he was silent again the following day, saying only at\nlast, \"We shall better know how to deal with them another time;\" and\ndy'd in a few minutes after.\n\nThe secretary's papers, with all the general's orders, instructions, and\ncorrespondence, falling into the enemy's hands, they selected and\ntranslated into French a number of the articles, which they printed, to\nprove the hostile intentions of the British court before the declaration\nof war. Among these I saw some letters of the general to the ministry,\nspeaking highly of the great service I had rendered the army, and\nrecommending me to their notice. David Hume, too, who was some years\nafter secretary to Lord Hertford, when minister in France, and afterward\nto General Conway, when secretary of state, told me he had seen among\nthe papers in that office, letters from Braddock highly recommending me.\nBut, the expedition having been unfortunate, my service, it seems, was\nnot thought of much value, for those recommendations were never of any\nuse to me.\n\nAs to rewards from himself, I ask'd only one, which was, that he would\ngive orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought\nservants, and that he would discharge such as had been already enlisted.\nThis he readily granted, and several were accordingly return'd to their\nmasters, on my application. Dunbar, when the command devolv'd on him,\nwas not so generous. He being at Philadelphia, on his retreat, or rather\nflight, I apply'd to him for the discharge of the servants of three poor\nfarmers of Lancaster county that he had enlisted, reminding him of the\nlate general's orders on that head. He promised me that, if the masters\nwould come to him at Trenton, where he should be in a few days on his\nmarch to New York, he would there deliver their men to them. They\naccordingly were at the expense and trouble of going to Trenton, and\nthere he refus'd to perform his promise, to their great loss and\ndisappointment.\n\nAs soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known, all\nthe owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bond to pay.\nTheir demands gave me a great deal of trouble, my acquainting them that\nthe money was ready in the paymaster's hands, but that orders for paying\nit must first be obtained from General Shirley, and my assuring them\nthat I had apply'd to that general by letter; but, he being at a\ndistance, an answer could not soon be receiv'd, and they must have\npatience, all this was not sufficient to satisfy, and some began to sue\nme. General Shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation\nby appointing commissioners to examine the claims, and ordering payment.\nThey amounted to near twenty thousand pound, which to pay would have\nruined me.\n\nBefore we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors Bond came to me\nwith a subscription paper for raising money to defray the expense of a\ngrand firework, which it was intended to exhibit at a rejoicing on\nreceipt of the news of our taking Fort Duquesne. I looked grave, and\nsaid it would, I thought, be time enough to prepare for the rejoicing\nwhen we knew we should have occasion to rejoice. They seem'd surpris'd\nthat I did not immediately comply with their proposal. \"Why the d--l!\"\nsays one of them, \"you surely don't suppose that the fort will not be\ntaken?\" \"I don't know that it will not be taken, but I know that the\nevents of war are subject to great uncertainty.\" I gave them the reasons\nof my doubting; the subscription was dropt, and the projectors thereby\nmissed the mortification they would have undergone if the firework had\nbeen prepared. Dr. Bond, on some other occasion afterward, said that he\ndid not like Franklin's forebodings.\n\nGovernor Morris, who had continually worried the Assembly with message\nafter message before the defeat of Braddock, to beat them into the\nmaking of acts to raise money for the defense of the province, without\ntaxing, among others, the proprietary estates, and had rejected all\ntheir bills for not having such an exempting clause, now redoubled his\nattacks with more hope of success, the danger and necessity being\ngreater. The Assembly, however, continu'd firm, believing they had\njustice on their side, and that it would be giving up an essential right\nif they suffered the governor to amend their money-bills. In one of the\nlast, indeed, which was for granting fifty thousand pounds, his propos'd\namendment was only of a single word. The bill expressed \"that all\nestates, real and personal, were to be taxed, those of the proprietaries\nnot excepted.\" His amendment was, for not read only: a small, but very\nmaterial alteration. However, when the news of this disaster reached\nEngland, our friends there, whom we had taken care to furnish with all\nthe Assembly's answers to the governor's messages, rais'd a clamor\nagainst the proprietaries for their meanness and injustice in giving\ntheir governor such instructions; some going so far as to say that, by\nobstructing the defense of their province, they forfeited their right to\nit. They were intimidated by this, and sent orders to their\nreceiver-general to add five thousand pounds of their money to whatever\nsum might be given by the Assembly for such purpose."

        "content": "This, being notified to the House, was accepted in lieu of their share\nof a general tax, and a new bill was form'd, with an exempting clause,\nwhich passed accordingly. By this act I was appointed one of the\ncommissioners for disposing of the money, sixty thousand pounds. I had\nbeen active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage, and had, at\nthe same time, drawn a bill for establishing and disciplining of a\nvoluntary militia, which I carried thro' the House without much\ndifficulty, as care was taken in it to leave the Quakers at their\nliberty. To promote the association necessary to form the militia, I\nwrote a dialogue, [14] stating and answering all the objections I could\nthink of to such a militia, which was printed, and had, as I thought,\ngreat effect.\n\n[14] This dialogue and the militia act are in the \"Gentleman's Magazine\"\nfor February and March, 1756.--[Marg. note.]\n\nWhile the several companies in the city and country were forming and\nlearning their exercise, the governor prevail'd with me to take charge\nof our North-western frontier, which was infested by the enemy, and\nprovide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops and\nbuilding a line of forts. I undertook this military business, tho' I did\nnot conceive myself well qualified for it. He gave me a commission with\nfull powers, and a parcel of blank commissions for officers, to be given\nto whom I thought fit. I had but little difficulty in raising men,\nhaving soon five hundred and sixty under my command. My son, who had in\nthe preceding war been an officer in the army rais'd against Canada, was\nmy aid-de-camp, and of great use to me. The Indians had burned\nGnadenhut, a village settled by the Moravians, and massacred the\ninhabitants; but the place was thought a good situation for one of the\nforts.\n\nIn order to march thither, I assembled the companies at Bethlehem, the\nchief establishment of those people. I was surprised to find it in so\ngood a posture of defense; the destruction of Gnadenhut had made them\napprehend danger. The principal buildings were defended by a stockade;\nthey had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from New York, and\nhad even plac'd quantities of small paving stones between the windows of\ntheir high stone houses, for their women to throw down upon the heads of\nany Indians that should attempt to force into them. The armed brethren,\ntoo, kept watch, and reliev'd as methodically as in any garrison town.\nIn conversation with the bishop, Spangenberg, I mention'd this my\nsurprise; for, knowing they had obtained an act of Parliament exempting\nthem from military duties in the colonies, I had suppos'd they were\nconscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms. He answer'd me that it was\nnot one of their established principles, but that, at the time of their\nobtaining that act, it was thought to be a principle with many of their\npeople. On this occasion, however, they, to their surprise, found it\nadopted by but a few. It seems they were either deceiv'd in themselves,\nor deceiv'd the Parliament; but common sense, aided by present danger,\nwill sometimes be too strong for whimsical opinions.\n\nIt was the beginning of January when we set out upon this business of\nbuilding forts. I sent one detachment toward the Minisink, with\ninstructions to erect one for the security of that upper part of the\ncountry, and another to the lower part, with similar instructions; and I\nconcluded to go myself with the rest of my force to Gnadenhut, where a\nfort was tho't more immediately necessary. The Moravians procur'd me\nfive waggons for our tools, stores, baggage, etc.\n\nJust before we left Bethlehem, eleven farmers, who had been driven from\ntheir plantations by the Indians, came to me requesting a supply of\nfirearms, that they might go back and fetch off their cattle. I gave\nthem each a gun with suitable ammunition. We had not march'd many miles\nbefore it began to rain, and it continued raining all day; there were no\nhabitations on the road to shelter us, till we arriv'd near night at the\nhouse of a German, where, and in his barn, we were all huddled together,\nas wet as water could make us. It was well we were not attack'd in our\nmarch, for our arms were of the most ordinary sort, and our men could\nnot keep their gun locks dry. The Indians are dextrous in contrivances\nfor that purpose, which we had not. They met that day the eleven poor\nfarmers above mentioned, and killed ten of them. The one who escap'd\ninform'd that his and his companions' guns would not go off, the priming\nbeing wet with the rain.\n\nThe next day being fair, we continu'd our march, and arriv'd at the\ndesolated Gnadenhut. There was a saw-mill near, round which were left\nseveral piles of boards, with which we soon hutted ourselves; an\noperation the more necessary at that inclement season, as we had no\ntents. Our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found\nthere, who had been half interr'd by the country people.\n\nThe next morning our fort was plann'd and mark'd out, the circumference\nmeasuring four hundred and fifty-five feet, which would require as many\npalisades to be made of trees, one with another, of a foot diameter\neach. Our axes, of which we had seventy, were immediately set to work to\ncut down trees, and, our men being dextrous in the use of them, great\ndespatch was made. Seeing the trees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to\nlook at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine; in six minutes\nthey had it upon the ground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter.\nEach pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long, pointed at one\nend. While these were preparing, our other men dug a trench all round,\nof three feet deep, in which the palisades were to be planted; and, our\nwaggons, the bodys being taken off, and the fore and hind wheels\nseparated by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch,\nwe had ten carriages, with two horses each, to bring the palisades from\nthe woods to the spot. When they were set up, our carpenters built a\nstage of boards all round within, about six feet high, for the men to\nstand on when to fire thro' the loopholes. We had one swivel gun, which\nwe mounted on one of the angles, and fir'd it as soon as fix'd, to let\nthe Indians know, if any were within hearing, that we had such pieces;\nand thus our fort, if such a magnificent name may be given to so\nmiserable a stockade, was finish'd in a week, though it rain'd so hard\nevery other day that the men could not work.\n\nThis gave me occasion to observe, that, when men are employ'd, they are\nbest content'd; for on the days they worked they were good-natur'd and\ncheerful, and, with the consciousness of having done a good day's work,\nthey spent the evening jollily; but on our idle days they were mutinous\nand quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork, the bread, etc., and in\ncontinual ill-humor, which put me in mind of a sea-captain, whose rule\nit was to keep his men constantly at work; and, when his mate once told\nhim that they had done every thing, and there was nothing further to\nemploy them about, \"Oh,\" says he, \"Make them scour the anchor.\""

        "content": "This kind of fort, however contemptible, is a sufficient defense against\nIndians, who have no cannon. Finding ourselves now posted securely, and\nhaving a place to retreat to on occasion, we ventur'd out in parties to\nscour the adjacent country. We met with no Indians, but we found the\nplaces on the neighboring hills where they had lain to watch our\nproceedings. There was an art in their contrivance of those places, that\nseems worth mention. It being winter, a fire was necessary for them; but\na common fire on the surface of the ground would by its light have\ndiscovered their position at a distance. They had therefore dug holes in\nthe ground about three feet diameter, and somewhat deeper; we saw where\nthey had with their hatchets cut off the charcoal from the sides of\nburnt logs lying in the woods. With these coals they had made small\nfires in the bottom of the holes, and we observ'd among the weeds and\ngrass the prints of their bodies, made by their laying all round, with\ntheir legs hanging down in the holes to keep their feet warm, which,\nwith them, is an essential point. This kind of fire, so manag'd, could\nnot discover them, either by its light, flame, sparks, or even smoke: it\nappear'd that their number was not great, and it seems they saw we were\ntoo many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage.\n\nWe had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister, Mr. Beatty, who\ncomplained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers and\nexhortations. When they enlisted, they were promised, besides pay and\nprovisions, a gill of rum a day, which was punctually serv'd out to\nthem, half in the morning, and the other half in the evening; and I\nobserv'd they were as punctual in attending to receive it; upon which I\nsaid to Mr. Beatty, \"It is, perhaps, below the dignity of your\nprofession to act as steward of the rum, but if you were to deal it out\nand only just after prayers, you would have them all about you.\" He\nliked the tho't, undertook the office, and, with the help of a few hands\nto measure out the liquor, executed it to satisfaction, and never were\nprayers more generally and more punctually attended; so that I thought\nthis method preferable to the punishment inflicted by some military laws\nfor non-attendance on divine service.\n\nI had hardly finish'd this business, and got my fort well stor'd with\nprovisions, when I receiv'd a letter from the governor, acquainting me\nthat he had call'd the Assembly, and wished my attendance there, if the\nposture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remaining there was\nno longer necessary. My friends, too, of the Assembly, pressing me by\ntheir letters to be, if possible, at the meeting, and my three intended\nforts being now compleated, and the inhabitants contented to remain on\ntheir farms under that protection, I resolved to return; the more\nwillingly, as a New England officer, Colonel Clapham, experienced in\nIndian war, being on a visit to our establishment, consented to accept\nthe command. I gave him a commission, and, parading the garrison, had it\nread before them, and introduc'd him to them as an officer who, from his\nskill in military affairs, was much more fit to command them than\nmyself; and, giving them a little exhortation, took my leave. I was\nescorted as far as Bethlehem, where I rested a few days to recover from\nthe fatigue I had undergone. The first night, being in a good bed, I\ncould hardly sleep, it was so different from my hard lodging on the\nfloor of our hut at Gnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two.\n\nWhile at Bethlehem, I inquir'd a little into the practice of the\nMoravians: some of them had accompanied me, and all were very kind to\nme. I found they work'd for a common stock, eat at common tables, and\nslept in common dormitories, great numbers together. In the dormitories\nI observed loopholes, at certain distances all along just under the\nceiling, which I thought judiciously placed for change of air. I was at\ntheir church, where I was entertain'd with good musick, the organ being\naccompanied with violins, hautboys, flutes, clarinets, etc. I understood\nthat their sermons were not usually preached to mixed congregations of\nmen, women, and children, as is our common practice, but that they\nassembled sometimes the married men, at other times their wives, then\nthe young men, the young women, and the little children, each division\nby itself. The sermon I heard was to the latter, who came in and were\nplac'd in rows on benches; the boys under the conduct of a young man,\ntheir tutor, and the girls conducted by a young woman. The discourse\nseem'd well adapted to their capacities, and was deliver'd in a\npleasing, familiar manner, coaxing them, as it were, to be good. They\nbehav'd very orderly, but looked pale and unhealthy, which made me\nsuspect they were kept too much within doors, or not allow'd sufficient\nexercise.\n\nI inquir'd concerning the Moravian marriages, whether the report was\ntrue that they were by lot. I was told that lots were us'd only in\nparticular cases; that generally, when a young man found himself\ndispos'd to marry, he inform'd the elders of his class, who consulted\nthe elder ladies that govern'd the young women. As these elders of the\ndifferent sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions\nof their respective pupils, they could best judge what matches were\nsuitable, and their judgments were generally acquiesc'd in; but if, for\nexample, it should happen that two or three young women were found to be\nequally proper for the young man, the lot was then recurred to. I\nobjected, if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the\nparties, some of them may chance to be very unhappy. \"And so they may,\"\nanswer'd my informer, \"if you let the parties chuse for themselves;\"\nwhich, indeed, I could not deny.\n\nBeing returned to Philadelphia, I found the association went on\nswimmingly, the inhabitants that were not Quakers having pretty\ngenerally come into it, formed themselves into companies, and chose\ntheir captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, according to the new law. Dr.\nB. visited me, and gave me an account of the pains he had taken to\nspread a general good liking to the law, and ascribed much to those\nendeavors. I had had the vanity to ascribe all to my Dialogue; however,\nnot knowing but that he might be in the right, I let him enjoy his\nopinion, which I take to be generally the best way in such cases. The\nofficers, meeting, chose me to be colonel of the regiment, which I this\ntime accepted. I forget how many companies we had, but we paraded about\ntwelve hundred well-looking men, with a company of artillery, who had\nbeen furnished with six brass field-pieces, which they had become so\nexpert in the use of as to fire twelve times in a minute. The first time\nI reviewed my regiment they accompanied me to my house, and would salute\nme with some rounds fired before my door, which shook down and broke\nseveral glasses of my electrical apparatus. And my new honour proved not\nmuch less brittle; for all our commissions were soon after broken by a\nrepeal of the law in England."

Franklin From an engraving by J. Thomson from the\noriginal picture by J. A. Duplessis]\n\n[Illustration: B. Franklin's signature]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWe Americans devour eagerly any piece of writing that purports to tell\nus the secret of success in life; yet how often we are disappointed to\nfind nothing but commonplace statements, or receipts that we know by\nheart but never follow. Most of the life stories of our famous and\nsuccessful men fail to inspire because they lack the human element\nthat makes the record real and brings the story within our grasp.\nWhile we are searching far and near for some Aladdin's Lamp to give\ncoveted fortune, there is ready at our hand if we will only reach out\nand take it, like the charm in Milton's _Comus_,\n\n\"Unknown, and like esteemed, and the dull swain\nTreads on it daily with his clouted shoon;\"\n\nthe interesting, human, and vividly told story of one of the wisest\nand most useful lives in our own history, and perhaps in any history.\nIn Franklin's _Autobiography_ is offered not so much a ready-made\nformula for success, as the companionship of a real flesh and blood\nman of extraordinary mind and quality, whose daily walk and\nconversation will help us to meet our own difficulties, much as does\nthe example of a wise and strong friend. While we are fascinated by\nthe story, we absorb the human experience through which a strong and\nhelpful character is building.\n\nThe thing that makes Franklin's _Autobiography_ different from every\nother life story of a great and successful man is just this human\naspect of the account. Franklin told the story of his life, as he\nhimself says, for the benefit of his posterity. He wanted to help them\nby the relation of his own rise from obscurity and poverty to eminence\nand wealth. He is not unmindful of the importance of his public\nservices and their recognition, yet his accounts of these achievements\nare given only as a part of the story, and the vanity displayed is\nincidental and in keeping with the honesty of the recital. There is\nnothing of the impossible in the method and practice of Franklin as he\nsets them forth. The youth who reads the fascinating story is\nastonished to find that Franklin in his early years struggled with the\nsame everyday passions and difficulties that he himself experiences,\nand he loses the sense of discouragement that comes from a\nrealization of his own shortcomings and inability to attain.\n\nThere are other reasons why the _Autobiography_ should be an intimate\nfriend of American young people. Here they may establish a close\nrelationship with one of the foremost Americans as well as one of the\nwisest men of his age."

        "content": "The life of Benjamin Franklin is of importance to every American\nprimarily because of the part he played in securing the independence\nof the United States and in establishing it as a nation. Franklin\nshares with Washington the honors of the Revolution, and of the events\nleading to the birth of the new nation. While Washington was the\nanimating spirit of the struggle in the colonies, Franklin was its\nablest champion abroad. To Franklin's cogent reasoning and keen\nsatire, we owe the clear and forcible presentation of the American\ncase in England and France; while to his personality and diplomacy as\nwell as to his facile pen, we are indebted for the foreign alliance\nand the funds without which Washington's work must have failed. His\npatience, fortitude, and practical wisdom, coupled with\nself-sacrificing devotion to the cause of his country, are hardly less\nnoticeable than similar qualities displayed by Washington. In fact,\nFranklin as a public man was much like Washington, especially in the\nentire disinterestedness of his public service.\n\nFranklin is also interesting to us because by his life and teachings\nhe has done more than any other American to advance the material\nprosperity of his countrymen. It is said that his widely and\nfaithfully read maxims made Philadelphia and Pennsylvania wealthy,\nwhile Poor Richard's pithy sayings, translated into many languages,\nhave had a world-wide influence.\n\nFranklin is a good type of our American manhood. Although not the\nwealthiest or the most powerful, he is undoubtedly, in the versatility\nof his genius and achievements, the greatest of our self-made men. The\nsimple yet graphic story in the _Autobiography_ of his steady rise\nfrom humble boyhood in a tallow-chandler shop, by industry, economy,\nand perseverance in self-improvement, to eminence, is the most\nremarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men. It is\nin itself a wonderful illustration of the results possible to be\nattained in a land of unequaled opportunity by following Franklin's\nmaxims.\n\nFranklin's fame, however, was not confined to his own country.\nAlthough he lived in a century notable for the rapid evolution of\nscientific and political thought and activity, yet no less a keen\njudge and critic than Lord Jeffrey, the famous editor of the\n_Edinburgh Review_, a century ago said that \"in one point of view\nthe name of Franklin must be considered as standing higher than any of\nthe others which illustrated the eighteenth century. Distinguished as\na statesman, he was equally great as a philosopher, thus uniting in\nhimself a rare degree of excellence in both these pursuits, to excel\nin either of which is deemed the highest praise.\"\n\nFranklin has indeed been aptly called \"many-sided.\" He was eminent in\nscience and public service, in diplomacy and in literature. He was the\nEdison of his day, turning his scientific discoveries to the benefit\nof his fellow-men. He perceived the identity of lightning and\nelectricity and set up the lightning rod. He invented the Franklin\nstove, still widely used, and refused to patent it. He possessed a\nmasterly shrewdness in business and practical affairs. Carlyle called\nhim the father of all the Yankees. He founded a fire company, assisted\nin founding a hospital, and improved the cleaning and lighting of\nstreets. He developed journalism, established the American\nPhilosophical Society, the public library in Philadelphia, and the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. He organized a postal system for the\ncolonies, which was the basis of the present United States Post\nOffice. Bancroft, the eminent historian, called him \"the greatest\ndiplomatist of his century.\" He perfected the Albany Plan of Union for\nthe colonies. He is the only statesman who signed the Declaration of\nIndependence, the Treaty of Alliance with France, the Treaty of Peace\nwith England, and the Constitution. As a writer, he has produced, in\nhis _Autobiography_ and in _Poor Richard's Almanac_, two works that\nare not surpassed by similar writing. He received honorary degrees\nfrom Harvard and Yale, from Oxford and St. Andrews, and was made a\nfellow of the Royal Society, which awarded him the Copley gold medal\nfor improving natural knowledge. He was one of the eight foreign\nassociates of the French Academy of Science.\n\nThe careful study of the _Autobiography_ is also valuable because of\nthe style in which it is written. If Robert Louis Stevenson is right\nin believing that his remarkable style was acquired by imitation then\nthe youth who would gain the power to express his ideas clearly,\nforcibly, and interestingly cannot do better than to study Franklin's\nmethod. Franklin's fame in the scientific world was due almost as much\nto his modest, simple, and sincere manner of presenting his\ndiscoveries and to the precision and clearness of the style in which\nhe described his experiments, as to the results he was able to\nannounce. Sir Humphry Davy, the celebrated English chemist, himself an\nexcellent literary critic as well as a great scientist, said: \"A\nsingular felicity guided all Franklin's researches, and by very small\nmeans he established very grand truths. The style and manner of his\npublication on electricity are almost as worthy of admiration as the\ndoctrine it contains.\"\n\nFranklin's place in literature is hard to determine because he was not\nprimarily a literary man. His aim in his writings as in his life work\nwas to be helpful to his fellow-men. For him writing was never an end\nin itself, but always a means to an end. Yet his success as a\nscientist, a statesman, and a diplomat, as well as socially, was in no\nlittle part due to his ability as a writer. \"His letters charmed all,\nand made his correspondence eagerly sought. His political arguments\nwere the joy of his party and the dread of his opponents. His\nscientific discoveries were explained in language at once so simple\nand so clear that plow-boy and exquisite could follow his thought or\nhis experiment to its conclusion.\"[1]\n\n[1] _The Many-Sided Franklin._ Paul L. Ford.\n\nAs far as American literature is concerned, Franklin has no\ncontemporaries. Before the _Autobiography_ only one literary work of\nimportance had been produced in this country--Cotton Mather's\n_Magnalia_, a church history of New England in a ponderous, stiff\nstyle. Franklin was the first American author to gain a wide and\npermanent reputation in Europe. The _Autobiography_, _Poor Richard_,\n_Father Abraham's Speech_ or _The Way to Wealth_, as well as some of\nthe _Bagatelles_, are as widely known abroad as any American writings.\nFranklin must also be classed as the first American humorist.\n\nEnglish literature of the eighteenth century was characterized by the\ndevelopment of prose. Periodical literature reached its perfection\nearly in the century in _The Tatler_ and _The Spectator_ of Addison\nand Steele. Pamphleteers flourished throughout the period. The\nhomelier prose of Bunyan and Defoe gradually gave place to the more\nelegant and artificial language of Samuel Johnson, who set the\nstandard for prose writing from 1745 onward. This century saw the\nbeginnings of the modern novel, in Fielding's _Tom Jones_,\nRichardson's _Clarissa Harlowe_, Sterne's _Tristram Shandy_, and\nGoldsmith's _Vicar of Wakefield_. Gibbon wrote _The Decline and Fall\nof the Roman Empire_, Hume his _History of England_, and Adam Smith\nthe _Wealth of Nations_."

        "content": "In the simplicity and vigor of his style Franklin more nearly\nresembles the earlier group of writers. In his first essays he was not\nan inferior imitator of Addison. In his numerous parables, moral\nallegories, and apologues he showed Bunyan's influence. But Franklin\nwas essentially a journalist. In his swift, terse style, he is most\nlike Defoe, who was the first great English journalist and master of\nthe newspaper narrative. The style of both writers is marked by\nhomely, vigorous expression, satire, burlesque, repartee. Here the\ncomparison must end. Defoe and his contemporaries were authors. Their\nvocation was writing and their success rests on the imaginative or\ncreative power they displayed. To authorship Franklin laid no claim.\nHe wrote no work of the imagination. He developed only incidentally a\nstyle in many respects as remarkable as that of his English\ncontemporaries. He wrote the best autobiography in existence, one of\nthe most widely known collections of maxims, and an unsurpassed series\nof political and social satires, because he was a man of unusual scope\nof power and usefulness, who knew how to tell his fellow-men the\nsecrets of that power and that usefulness.\n\nThe Story of the Autobiography\n\nThe account of how Franklin's _Autobiography_ came to be written and\nof the adventures of the original manuscript forms in itself an\ninteresting story. The _Autobiography_ is Franklin's longest work,\nand yet it is only a fragment. The first part, written as a letter to\nhis son, William Franklin, was not intended for publication; and the\ncomposition is more informal and the narrative more personal than in\nthe second part, from 1730 on, which was written with a view to\npublication. The entire manuscript shows little evidence of revision.\nIn fact, the expression is so homely and natural that his grandson,\nWilliam Temple Franklin, in editing the work changed some of the\nphrases because he thought them inelegant and vulgar.\n\nFranklin began the story of his life while on a visit to his friend,\nBishop Shipley, at Twyford, in Hampshire, southern England, in 1771.\nHe took the manuscript, completed to 1731, with him when he returned\nto Philadelphia in 1775. It was left there with his other papers when\nhe went to France in the following year, and disappeared during the\nconfusion incident to the Revolution. Twenty-three pages of closely\nwritten manuscript fell into the hands of Abel James, an old friend,\nwho sent a copy to Franklin at Passy, near Paris, urging him to\ncomplete the story. Franklin took up the work at Passy in 1784 and\ncarried the narrative forward a few months. He changed the plan to\nmeet his new purpose of writing to benefit the young reader. His work\nwas soon interrupted and was not resumed until 1788, when he was at\nhome in Philadelphia. He was now old, infirm, and suffering, and was\nstill engaged in public service. Under these discouraging conditions\nthe work progressed slowly. It finally stopped when the narrative\nreached the year 1757. Copies of the manuscript were sent to friends\nof Franklin in England and France, among others to Monsieur Le\nVeillard at Paris.\n\nThe first edition of the _Autobiography_ was published in French at\nParis in 1791. It was clumsily and carelessly translated, and was\nimperfect and unfinished. Where the translator got the manuscript is\nnot known. Le Veillard disclaimed any knowledge of the publication.\nFrom this faulty French edition many others were printed, some in\nGermany, two in England, and another in France, so great was the\ndemand for the work.\n\nIn the meantime the original manuscript of the _Autobiography_ had\nstarted on a varied and adventurous career. It was left by Franklin\nwith his other works to his grandson, William Temple Franklin, whom\nFranklin designated as his literary executor. When Temple Franklin\ncame to publish his grandfather's works in 1817, he sent the original\nmanuscript of the _Autobiography_ to the daughter of Le Veillard in\nexchange for her father's copy, probably thinking the clearer\ntranscript would make better printer's copy. The original manuscript\nthus found its way to the Le Veillard family and connections, where it\nremained until sold in 1867 to Mr. John Bigelow, United States\nMinister to France. By him it was later sold to Mr. E. Dwight Church\nof New York, and passed with the rest of Mr. Church's library into the\npossession of Mr. Henry E. Huntington. The original manuscript of\nFranklin's _Autobiography_ now rests in the vault in Mr. Huntington's\nresidence at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-seventh Street, New York City.\n\nWhen Mr. Bigelow came to examine his purchase, he was astonished to\nfind that what people had been reading for years as the authentic\n_Life of Benjamin Franklin by Himself_, was only a garbled and\nincomplete version of the real _Autobiography_. Temple Franklin had\ntaken unwarranted liberties with the original. Mr. Bigelow says he\nfound more than twelve hundred changes in the text. In 1868,\ntherefore, Mr. Bigelow published the standard edition of Franklin's\n_Autobiography_. It corrected errors in the previous editions and was\nthe first English edition to contain the short fourth part,\ncomprising the last few pages of the manuscript, written during the\nlast year of Franklin's life. Mr. Bigelow republished the\n_Autobiography_, with additional interesting matter, in three volumes\nin 1875, in 1905, and in 1910. The text in this volume is that of Mr.\nBigelow's editions.[2]\n\n[2] For the division into chapters and the chapter\ntitles, however, the present editor is responsible.\n\nThe _Autobiography_ has been reprinted in the United States many\nscores of times and translated into all the languages of Europe. It\nhas never lost its popularity and is still in constant demand at\ncirculating libraries. The reason for this popularity is not far to\nseek. For in this work Franklin told in a remarkable manner the story\nof a remarkable life. He displayed hard common sense and a practical\nknowledge of the art of living. He selected and arranged his material,\nperhaps unconsciously, with the unerring instinct of the journalist\nfor the best effects. His success is not a little due to his plain,\nclear, vigorous English. He used short sentences and words, homely\nexpressions, apt illustrations, and pointed allusions. Franklin had a\nmost interesting, varied, and unusual life. He was one of the greatest\nconversationalists of his time.\n\nHis book is the record of that unusual life told in Franklin's own\nunexcelled conversational style. It is said that the best parts of\nBoswell's famous biography of Samuel Johnson are those parts where\nBoswell permits Johnson to tell his own story. In the _Autobiography_\na no less remarkable man and talker than Samuel Johnson is telling his\nown story throughout.\n\nF. W.

        "content": "Dear son: I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes\nof my ancestors. You may remember the inquiries I made among the\nremains of my relations when you were with me in England, and the\njourney I undertook for that purpose. Imagining it may be equally\nagreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which\nyou are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week's\nuninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to\nwrite them for you. To which I have besides some other inducements.\nHaving emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and\nbred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the\nworld, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share\nof felicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with the\nblessing of God so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, as\nthey may find some of them suitable to their own situations, and\ntherefore fit to be imitated.\n\n[3] A small village not far from Winchester in\nHampshire, southern England. Here was the country seat\nof the Bishop of St. Asaph, Dr. Jonathan Shipley, the\n\"good Bishop,\" as Dr. Franklin used to style him. Their\nrelations were intimate and confidential. In his pulpit,\nand in the House of Lords, as well as in society, the\nbishop always opposed the harsh measures of the Crown\ntoward the Colonies.--Bigelow.\n\nThat felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to\nsay, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to\na repetition of the same life from its beginning, only asking the\nadvantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of\nthe first. So I might, besides correcting the faults, change some\nsinister accidents and events of it for others more favourable. But\nthough this were denied, I should still accept the offer. Since such a\nrepetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like living\none's life over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and to\nmake that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in\nwriting.\n\nHereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to\nbe talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall\nindulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to\nage, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since\nthis may be read or not as anyone pleases. And, lastly (I may as well\nconfess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps\nI shall a good deal gratify my own _vanity_.[4] Indeed, I scarce ever\nheard or saw the introductory words, \"_Without vanity I may say_,\"\netc., but some vain thing immediately followed. Most people dislike\nvanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves; but I\ngive it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it\nis often productive of good to the possessor, and to others that are\nwithin his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would\nnot be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity\namong the other comforts of life.\n\n[4] In this connection Woodrow Wilson says, \"And yet the\nsurprising and delightful thing about this book (the\n_Autobiography_) is that, take it all in all, it has not\nthe low tone of conceit, but is a staunch man's sober\nand unaffected assessment of himself and the\ncircumstances of his career.\"\n\nGibbon and Hume, the great British historians, who were\ncontemporaries of Franklin, express in their\nautobiographies the same feeling about the propriety of\njust self-praise.\n\nAnd now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility to\nacknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His\nkind providence, which lead me to the means I used and gave them\nsuccess. My belief of this induces me to _hope_, though I must not\n_presume_, that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me,\nin continuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse,\nwhich I may experience as others have done; the complexion of my\nfuture fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless\nto us even our afflictions.\n\nThe notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in\ncollecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands, furnished me with\nseveral particulars relating to our ancestors. From these notes I\nlearned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in\nNorthamptonshire,[5] for three hundred years, and how much longer he\nknew not (perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin, that before\nwas the name of an order of people,[6] was assumed by them as a\nsurname when others took surnames all over the kingdom), on a freehold\nof about thirty acres, aided by the smith's business, which had\ncontinued in the family till his time, the eldest son being always\nbred to that business; a custom which he and my father followed as to\ntheir eldest sons. When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an\naccount of their births, marriages and burials from the year 1555\nonly, there being no registers kept in that parish at any time\npreceding. By that register I perceived that I was the youngest son of\nthe youngest son for five generations back. My grandfather Thomas, who\nwas born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow\nbusiness longer, when he went to live with his son John, a dyer at\nBanbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship.\nThere my grandfather died and lies buried. We saw his gravestone in\n1758. His eldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton, and left it\nwith the land to his only child, a daughter, who, with her husband,\none Fisher, of Wellingborough, sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of the\nmanor there. My grandfather had four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas,\nJohn, Benjamin and Josiah. I will give you what account I can of them\nat this distance from my papers, and if these are not lost in my\nabsence, you will among them find many more particulars.\n\n[5] See _Introduction_.\n\n[6] A small landowner.\n\nThomas was bred a smith under his father; but, being ingenious, and\nencouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an Esquire Palmer,\nthen the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualified himself for\nthe business of scrivener; became a considerable man in the county;\nwas a chief mover of all public-spirited undertakings for the county\nor town of Northampton, and his own village, of which many instances\nwere related of him; and much taken notice of and patronized by the\nthen Lord Halifax. He died in 1702, January 6, old style,[7] just four\nyears to a day before I was born. The account we received of his life\nand character from some old people at Ecton, I remember, struck you as\nsomething extraordinary, from its similarity to what you knew of mine.\n\"Had he died on the same day,\" you said, \"one might have supposed a\ntransmigration.\"\n\n[7] January 17, new style. This change in the calendar\nwas made in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, and adopted in\nEngland in 1752. Every year whose number in the common\nreckoning since Christ is not divisible by 4, as well as\nevery year whose number is divisible by 100 but not by\n400, shall have 365 days, and all other years shall have\n366 days. In the eighteenth century there was a\ndifference of eleven days between the old and the new\nstyle of reckoning, which the English Parliament\ncanceled by making the 3rd of September, 1752, the 14th.\nThe Julian calendar, or \"old style,\" is still retained\nin Russia and Greece, whose dates consequently are now\n13 days behind those of other Christian countries."

I\nremember him well, for when I was a boy he came over to my father in\nBoston, and lived in the house with us some years. He lived to a\ngreat age. His grandson, Samuel Franklin, now lives in Boston. He left\nbehind him two quarto volumes, MS., of his own poetry, consisting of\nlittle occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations, of\nwhich the following, sent to me, is a specimen.[8] He had formed a\nshort-hand of his own, which he taught me, but, never practising it, I\nhave now forgot it. I was named after this uncle, there being a\nparticular affection between him and my father. He was very pious, a\ngreat attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he took down in\nhis short-hand, and had with him many volumes of them. He was also\nmuch of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station. There fell\nlately into my hands, in London, a collection he had made of all the\nprincipal pamphlets relating to public affairs, from 1641 to 1717;\nmany of the volumes are wanting as appears by the numbering, but\nthere still remain eight volumes in folio, and twenty-four in quarto\nand in octavo. A dealer in old books met with them, and knowing me by\nmy sometimes buying of him, he brought them to me. It seems my uncle\nmust have left them here when he went to America, which was about\nfifty years since. There are many of his notes in the margins.\n\n[8] The specimen is not in the manuscript of the\n_Autobiography_.\n\nThis obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and\ncontinued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary, when they were\nsometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal against\npopery. They had got an English Bible, and to conceal and secure it,\nit was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a\njoint-stool. When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, he\nturned up the joint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then\nunder the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice\nif he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual\ncourt. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet,\nwhen the Bible remained concealed under it as before. This anecdote I\nhad from my uncle Benjamin. The family continued all of the Church of\nEngland till about the end of Charles the Second's reign, when some of\nthe ministers that had been outed for non-conformity, holding\nconventicles[9] in Northamptonshire, Benjamin and Josiah adhered to\nthem, and so continued all their lives: the rest of the family\nremained with the Episcopal Church.\n\n[9] Secret gatherings of dissenters from the established\nChurch.\n\n[Illustration: Birthplace of Franklin. Milk Street, Boston.]\n\nJosiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three\nchildren into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having been\nforbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable\nmen of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was\nprevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy\ntheir mode of religion with freedom. By the same wife he had four\nchildren more born there, and by a second wife ten more, in all\nseventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one time at his\ntable, who all grew up to be men and women, and married; I was the\nyoungest son, and the youngest child but two, and was born in Boston,\nNew England.[10] My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger,\ndaughter of Peter Folger, one of the first settlers of New England, of\nwhom honorable mention is made by Cotton Mather,[11] in his church\nhistory of that country, entitled _Magnalia Christi Americana_, as \"_a\ngodly, learned Englishman_,\" if I remember the words rightly. I have\nheard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces, but only one of\nthem was printed, which I saw now many years since. It was written in\n1675, in the home-spun verse of that time and people, and addressed to\nthose then concerned in the government there. It was in favour of\nliberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists, Quakers, and\nother sectaries that had been under persecution, ascribing the Indian\nwars, and other distresses that had befallen the country, to that\npersecution, as so many judgments of God to punish so heinous an\noffense, and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws. The whole\nappeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness and\nmanly freedom. The six concluding lines I remember, though I have\nforgotten the two first of the stanza; but the purport of them was,\nthat his censures proceeded from good-will, and, therefore, he would\nbe known to be the author.\n\n\"Because to be a libeller (says he)\nI hate it with my heart;\nFrom Sherburne town,[12] where now I dwell\nMy name I do put here;\nWithout offense your real friend,\nIt is Peter Folgier.\"\n\n[10] Franklin was born on Sunday, January 6, old style,\n1706, in a house on Milk Street, opposite the Old South\nMeeting House, where he was baptized on the day of his\nbirth, during a snowstorm. The house where he was born\nwas burned in 1810.--Griffin.\n\n[11] Cotton Mather (1663-1728), clergyman, author, and\nscholar. Pastor of the North Church, Boston. He took an\nactive part in the persecution of witchcraft.\n\n[12] Nantucket.\n\nMy elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades. I was\nput to the grammar-school at eight years of age, my father intending\nto devote me, as the tithe[13] of his sons, to the service of the\nChurch. My early readiness in learning to read (which must have been\nvery early, as I do not remember when I could not read), and the\nopinion of all his friends, that I should certainly make a good\nscholar, encouraged him in this purpose of his. My uncle Benjamin,\ntoo, approved of it, and proposed to give me all his short-hand\nvolumes of sermons, I suppose as a stock to set up with, if I would\nlearn his character.[14] I continued, however, at the grammar-school\nnot quite one year, though in that time I had risen gradually from the\nmiddle of the class of that year to be the head of it, and farther was\nremoved into the next class above it, in order to go with that into\nthe third at the end of the year. But my father, in the meantime, from\na view of the expense of a college education, which having so large a\nfamily he could not well afford, and the mean living many so educated\nwere afterwards able to obtain--reasons that he gave to his friends in\nmy hearing--altered his first intention, took me from the\ngrammar-school, and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic,\nkept by a then famous man, Mr. George Brownell, very successful in\nhis profession generally, and that by mild, encouraging methods. Under\nhim I acquired fair writing pretty soon, but I failed in the\narithmetic, and made no progress in it. At ten years old I was taken\nhome to assist my father in his business, which was that of a\ntallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business he was not bred to, but\nhad assumed on his arrival in New England, and on finding his dyeing\ntrade would not maintain his family, being in little request.\nAccordingly, I was employed in cutting wick for the candles, filling\nthe dipping mould and the moulds for cast candles, attending the shop,\ngoing of errands, etc.\n\n[13] Tenth.\n\n[14] System of short-hand.\n\nI disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea, but my\nfather declared against it; however, living near the water, I was much\nin and about it, learnt early to swim well, and to manage boats; and\nwhen in a boat or canoe with other boys, I was commonly allowed to\ngovern, especially in any case of difficulty; and upon other occasions\nI was generally a leader among the boys, and sometimes led them into\nscrapes, of which I will mention one instance, as it shows an early\nprojecting public spirit, tho' not then justly conducted."

        "content": "There was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond, on the edge\nof which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows. By much\ntrampling, we had made it a mere quagmire. My proposal was to build a\nwharf there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large\nheap of stones, which were intended for a new house near the marsh,\nand which would very well suit our purpose. Accordingly, in the\nevening, when the workmen were gone, I assembled a number of my\nplayfellows, and working with them diligently like so many emmets,\nsometimes two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and built\nour little wharf. The next morning the workmen were surprised at\nmissing the stones, which were found in our wharf. Inquiry was made\nafter the removers; we were discovered and complained of; several of\nus were corrected by our fathers; and, though I pleaded the usefulness\nof the work, mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not\nhonest.\n\nI think you may like to know something of his person and character. He\nhad an excellent constitution of body, was of middle stature, but well\nset, and very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily, was\nskilled a little in music, and had a clear, pleasing voice, so that\nwhen he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal, as he\nsometimes did in an evening after the business of the day was over, it\nwas extremely agreeable to hear. He had a mechanical genius too, and,\non occasion, was very handy in the use of other tradesmen's tools; but\nhis great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment\nin prudential matters, both in private and publick affairs. In the\nlatter, indeed, he was never employed, the numerous family he had to\neducate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to\nhis trade; but I remember well his being frequently visited by leading\npeople, who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of\nthe church he belonged to, and showed a good deal of respect for his\njudgment and advice: he was also much consulted by private persons\nabout their affairs when any difficulty occurred, and frequently\nchosen an arbitrator between contending parties. At his table he liked\nto have, as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor to\nconverse with, and always took care to start some ingenious or useful\ntopic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of his\nchildren. By this means he turned our attention to what was good,\njust, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice was\never taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether it\nwas well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor,\npreferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind, so\nthat I was bro't up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as\nto be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so\nunobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a\nfew hours after dinner what I dined upon. This has been a convenience\nto me in traveling, where my companions have been sometimes very\nunhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate,\nbecause better instructed, tastes and appetites.\n\nMy mother had likewise an excellent constitution: she suckled all her\nten children. I never knew either my father or mother to have any\nsickness but that of which they dy'd, he at 89, and she at 85 years of\nage. They lie buried together at Boston, where I some years since\nplaced a marble over their grave,[15] with this inscription:\n\nJosiah Franklin,\nand\nAbiah his wife,\nlie here interred.\nThey lived lovingly together in wedlock\nfifty-five years.\nWithout an estate, or any gainful employment,\nBy constant labor and industry,\nwith God's blessing,\nThey maintained a large family\ncomfortably,\nand brought up thirteen children\nand seven grandchildren\nreputably.\nFrom this instance, reader,\nBe encouraged to diligence in thy calling,\nAnd distrust not Providence.\nHe was a pious and prudent man;\nShe, a discreet and virtuous woman.\nTheir youngest son,\nIn filial regard to their memory,\nPlaces this stone.\nJ. F. born 1655, died 1744, Ætat 89.\nA. F. born 1667, died 1752,----85.\n\n[15] This marble having decayed, the citizens of Boston\nin 1827 erected in its place a granite obelisk,\ntwenty-one feet high, bearing the original inscription\nquoted in the text and another explaining the erection\nof the monument.\n\nBy my rambling digressions I perceive myself to be grown old. I us'd\nto write more methodically. But one does not dress for private company\nas for a publick ball. 'Tis perhaps only negligence.\n\nTo return: I continued thus employed in my father's business for two\nyears, that is, till I was twelve years old; and my brother John, who\nwas bred to that business, having left my father, married, and set up\nfor himself at Rhode Island, there was all appearance that I was\ndestined to supply his place, and become a tallow-chandler. But my\ndislike to the trade continuing, my father was under apprehensions\nthat if he did not find one for me more agreeable, I should break away\nand get to sea, as his son Josiah had done, to his great vexation. He\ntherefore sometimes took me to walk with him, and see joiners,\nbricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work, that he might\nobserve my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other\non land. It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen\nhandle their tools; and it has been useful to me, having learnt so\nmuch by it as to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a\nworkman could not readily be got, and to construct little machines for\nmy experiments, while the intention of making the experiment was fresh\nand warm in my mind. My father at last fixed upon the cutler's trade,\nand my uncle Benjamin's son Samuel, who was bred to that business in\nLondon, being about that time established in Boston, I was sent to be\nwith him some time on liking. But his expectations of a fee with me\ndispleasing my father, I was taken home again.\n\nII\n\nBEGINNING LIFE AS A PRINTER\n\nFrom a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that came\ninto my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the _Pilgrim's\nProgress_, my first collection was of John Bunyan's works in separate\nlittle volumes. I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton's\n_Historical Collections_; they were small chapmen's books,[16] and\ncheap, 40 or 50 in all. My father's little library consisted chiefly\nof books in polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since\noften regretted that, at a time when I had such a thirst for\nknowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way, since it was\nnow resolved I should not be a clergyman. Plutarch's _Lives_ there was\nin which I read abundantly, and I still think that time spent to great\nadvantage. There was also a book of DeFoe's, called an _Essay on\nProjects_, and another of Dr. Mather's, called _Essays to do Good_,\nwhich perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on\nsome of the principal future events of my life.\n\n[16] Small books, sold by chapmen or peddlers."

        "content": "This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a\nprinter, though he had already one son (James) of that profession. In\n1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and letters\nto set up his business in Boston. I liked it much better than that of\nmy father, but still had a hankering for the sea. To prevent the\napprehended effect of such an inclination, my father was impatient to\nhave me bound to my brother. I stood out some time, but at last was\npersuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve years\nold. I was to serve as an apprentice till I was twenty-one years of\nage, only I was to be allowed journeyman's wages during the last year.\nIn a little time I made great proficiency in the business, and became\na useful hand to my brother. I now had access to better books. An\nacquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes\nto borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon and clean.\nOften I sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night, when\nthe book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the\nmorning, lest it should be missed or wanted.\n\nAnd after some time an ingenious tradesman, Mr. Matthew Adams, who\nhad a pretty collection of books, and who frequented our\nprinting-house, took notice of me, invited me to his library, and\nvery kindly lent me such books as I chose to read. I now took a fancy\nto poetry, and made some little pieces; my brother, thinking it might\nturn to account, encouraged me, and put me on composing occasional\nballads. One was called _The Lighthouse Tragedy_, and contained an\naccount of the drowning of Captain Worthilake, with his two daughters:\nthe other was a sailor's song, on the taking of _Teach_ (or\nBlackbeard) the pirate. They were wretched stuff, in the\nGrub-street-ballad style;[17] and when they were printed he sent me\nabout the town to sell them. The first sold wonderfully, the event\nbeing recent, having made a great noise. This flattered my vanity; but\nmy father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances, and telling me\nverse-makers were generally beggars. So I escaped being a poet, most\nprobably a very bad one; but as prose writing has been of great use to\nme in the course of my life, and was a principal means of my\nadvancement, I shall tell you how, in such a situation, I acquired\nwhat little ability I have in that way.\n\n[17] Grub-street: famous in English literature as the\nhome of poor writers.\n\nThere was another bookish lad in the town, John Collins by name, with\nwhom I was intimately acquainted. We sometimes disputed, and very fond\nwe were of argument, and very desirous of confuting one another,\nwhich disputatious turn, by the way, is apt to become a very bad\nhabit, making people often extremely disagreeable in company by the\ncontradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice; and thence,\nbesides souring and spoiling the conversation, is productive of\ndisgusts and, perhaps enmities where you may have occasion for\nfriendship. I had caught it by reading my father's books of dispute\nabout religion. Persons of good sense, I have since observed, seldom\nfall into it, except lawyers, university men, and men of all sorts\nthat have been bred at Edinborough.\n\nA question was once, somehow or other, started between Collins and me,\nof the propriety of educating the female sex in learning, and their\nabilities for study. He was of opinion that it was improper, and that\nthey were naturally unequal to it. I took the contrary side, perhaps a\nlittle for dispute's sake. He was naturally more eloquent, had a ready\nplenty of words, and sometimes, as I thought, bore me down more by his\nfluency than by the strength of his reasons. As we parted without\nsettling the point, and were not to see one another again for some\ntime, I sat down to put my arguments in writing, which I copied fair\nand sent to him. He answered, and I replied. Three or four letters of\na side had passed, when my father happened to find my papers and read\nthem. Without entering into the discussion, he took occasion to talk\nto me about the manner of my writing; observed that, though I had the\nadvantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing (which I\now'd to the printing-house), I fell far short in elegance of\nexpression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he convinced me by\nseveral instances. I saw the justice of his remarks, and thence grew\nmore attentive to the manner in writing, and determined to endeavor at\nimprovement.\n\nAbout this time I met with an odd volume of the _Spectator_.[18] It was\nthe third. I had never before seen any of them. I bought it, read it\nover and over, and was much delighted with it. I thought the writing\nexcellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it. With this view I\ntook some of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment in\neach sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at\nthe book, try'd to compleat the papers again, by expressing each\nhinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed\nbefore, in any suitable words that should come to hand. Then I\ncompared my _Spectator_ with the original, discovered some of my\nfaults, and corrected them. But I found I wanted a stock of words, or\na readiness in recollecting and using them, which I thought I should\nhave acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses; since\nthe continual occasion for words of the same import, but of different\nlength, to suit the measure, or of different sound for the rhyme,\nwould have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for\nvariety, and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind, and make\nme master of it. Therefore I took some of the tales and turned them\ninto verse; and, after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten the\nprose, turned them back again. I also sometimes jumbled my collections\nof hints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce\nthem into the best order, before I began to form the full sentences\nand compleat the paper. This was to teach me method in the arrangement\nof thoughts. By comparing my work afterwards with the original, I\ndiscovered many faults and amended them; but I sometimes had the\npleasure of fancying that, in certain particulars of small import, I\nhad been lucky enough to improve the method of the language, and this\nencouraged me to think I might possibly in time come to be a tolerable\nEnglish writer, of which I was extremely ambitious. My time for these\nexercises and for reading was at night, after work or before it began\nin the morning, or on Sundays, when I contrived to be in the\nprinting-house alone, evading as much as I could the common attendance\non public worship which my father used to exact of me when I was under\nhis care, and which indeed I still thought a duty, thought I could\nnot, as it seemed to me, afford time to practise it.\n\n[18] A daily London journal, comprising satirical essays\non social subjects, published by Addison and Steele in\n1711-1712. The _Spectator_ and its predecessor, the\n_Tatler_ (1709), marked the beginning of periodical\nliterature."

        "content": "When about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book, written by\none Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet. I determined to go into it.\nMy brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boarded\nhimself and his apprentices in another family. My refusing to eat\nflesh occasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid for my\nsingularity. I made myself acquainted with Tryon's manner of preparing\nsome of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hasty\npudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if he\nwould give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would\nboard myself. He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I\ncould save half what he paid me. This was an additional fund for\nbuying books. But I had another advantage in it. My brother and the\nrest going from the printing-house to their meals, I remained there\nalone, and, dispatching presently my light repast, which often was no\nmore than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins or a tart\nfrom the pastry-cook's, and a glass of water, had the rest of the time\ntill their return for study, in which I made the greater progress,\nfrom that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which\nusually attend temperance in eating and drinking.\n\nAnd now it was that, being on some occasion made asham'd of my\nignorance in figures, which I had twice failed in learning when at\nschool, I took Cocker's book of Arithmetick, and went through the\nwhole by myself with great ease. I also read Seller's and Shermy's\nbooks of Navigation, and became acquainted with the little geometry\nthey contain; but never proceeded far in that science. And I read\nabout this time Locke _On Human Understanding_,[19] and the _Art of\nThinking_, by Messrs. du Port Royal.[20]\n\n[19] John Locke (1632-1704), a celebrated English\nphilosopher, founder of the so-called \"common-sense\"\nschool of philosophers. He drew up a constitution for\nthe colonists of Carolina.\n\n[20] A noted society of scholarly and devout men\noccupying the abbey of Port Royal near Paris, who\npublished learned works, among them the one here\nreferred to, better known as the _Port Royal Logic_.\n\nWhile I was intent on improving my language, I met with an English\ngrammar (I think it was Greenwood's), at the end of which there were\ntwo little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the latter\nfinishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic[21] method; and\nsoon after I procur'd Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates, wherein\nthere are many instances of the same method. I was charm'd with it,\nadopted it, dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation,\nand put on the humble inquirer and doubter. And being then, from\nreading Shaftesbury and Collins, become a real doubter in many points\nof our religious doctrine, I found this method safest for myself and\nvery embarrassing to those against whom I used it; therefore I took a\ndelight in it, practis'd it continually, and grew very artful and\nexpert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge, into\nconcessions, the consequences of which they did not foresee,\nentangling them in difficulties out of which they could not extricate\nthemselves, and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor my\ncause always deserved. I continu'd this method some few years, but\ngradually left it, retaining only the habit of expressing myself in\nterms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced anything that\nmay possibly be disputed, the words _certainly_, _undoubtedly_, or any\nothers that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather\nsay, I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to\nme, or _I should think it so or so_, for such and such reasons; or _I\nimagine it to be so_; or _it is so, if I am not mistaken_. This habit,\nI believe, has been of great advantage to me when I have had occasion\nto inculcate my opinions, and persuade men into measures that I have\nbeen from time to time engaged in promoting; and, as the chief ends of\nconversation are to _inform_ or to be _informed_, to _please_ or to\n_persuade_, I wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen their\npower of doing good by a positive, assuming manner, that seldom fails\nto disgust, tends to create opposition, and to defeat everyone of\nthose purposes for which speech was given to us, to wit, giving or\nreceiving information or pleasure. For, if you would inform, a\npositive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may\nprovoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention. If you wish\ninformation and improvement from the knowledge of others, and yet at\nthe same time express yourself as firmly fix'd in your present\nopinions, modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation, will\nprobably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error. And by\nsuch a manner, you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in _pleasing_\nyour hearers, or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire.\nPope[22] says, judiciously:\n\n_\"Men should be taught as if you taught them not,\nAnd things unknown propos'd as things forgot;\"_\n\nfarther recommending to us\n\n\"To speak, tho' sure, with seeming diffidence.\"\n\nAnd he might have coupled with this line that\nwhich he has coupled with another, I think,\nless properly,\n\n\"For want of modesty is want of sense.\"\n\nIf you ask, Why less properly? I must repeat the lines,\n\n\"Immodest words admit of no defense,\nFor want of modesty is want of sense.\"\n\nNow, is not _want of sense_ (where a man is so unfortunate as to want\nit) some apology for his _want of modesty_? and would not the lines\nstand more justly thus?\n\n\"Immodest words admit _but_ this defense,\nThat want of modesty is want of sense.\"\n\nThis, however, I should submit to better judgments.\n\n[21] Socrates confuted his opponents in argument by\nasking questions so skillfully devised that the answers\nwould confirm the questioner's position or show the\nerror of the opponent.\n\n[22] Alexander Pope (1688-1744), the greatest English\npoet of the first half of the eighteenth century.\n\nMy brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper. It was\nthe second that appeared in America,[23] and was called the New England\nCourant. The only one before it was the Boston News-Letter. I remember\nhis being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking, as\nnot likely to succeed, one newspaper being, in their judgment, enough\nfor America. At this time (1771) there are not less than\nfive-and-twenty. He went on, however, with the undertaking, and after\nhaving worked in composing the types and printing off the sheets, I\nwas employed to carry the papers thro' the streets to the customers.\n\n[23] Franklin's memory does not serve him correctly here.\nThe _Courant_ was really the fifth newspaper established\nin America, although generally called the fourth,\nbecause the first, _Public Occurrences_, published in\nBoston in 1690, was suppressed after the first issue.\nFollowing is the order in which the other four papers\nwere published: _Boston News Letter_, 1704; _Boston\nGazette_, December 21, 1719; _The American Weekly\nMercury_, Philadelphia, December 22, 1719; _The New\nEngland Courant_, 1721.\n\n[Illustration: First page of The New England Courant of Dec. 4-11,\n1721.

Hearing their\nconversations, and their accounts of the approbation their papers were\nreceived with, I was excited to try my hand among them; but, being\nstill a boy, and suspecting that my brother would object to printing\nanything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine, I contrived to\ndisguise my hand, and, writing an anonymous paper, I put it in at\nnight under the door of the printing-house. It was found in the\nmorning, and communicated to his writing friends when they call'd in\nas usual. They read it, commented on it in my hearing, and I had the\nexquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation, and that,\nin their different guesses at the author, none were named but men of\nsome character among us for learning and ingenuity. I suppose now that\nI was rather lucky in my judges, and that perhaps they were not really\nso very good ones as I then esteem'd them.\n\nEncourag'd, however, by this, I wrote and conveyed in the same way to\nthe press several more papers which were equally approv'd; and I kept\nmy secret till my small fund of sense for such performances was pretty\nwell exhausted, and then I discovered[24] it, when I began to be\nconsidered a little more by my brother's acquaintance, and in a manner\nthat did not quite please him, as he thought, probably with reason,\nthat it tended to make me too vain. And, perhaps, this might be one\noccasion of the differences that we began to have about this time.\nThough a brother, he considered himself as my master, and me as his\napprentice, and, accordingly, expected the same services from me as he\nwould from another, while I thought he demean'd me too much in some he\nrequir'd of me, who from a brother expected more indulgence. Our\ndisputes were often brought before our father, and I fancy I was\neither generally in the right, or else a better pleader, because the\njudgment was generally in my favor. But my brother was passionate,\nand had often beaten me, which I took extreamly amiss; and, thinking\nmy apprenticeship very tedious, I was continually wishing for some\nopportunity of shortening it, which at length offered in a manner\nunexpected.\n\n[24] Disclosed.\n\n[Illustration: \"I was employed to carry the papers thro' the streets\nto the customers\"]\n\nOne of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point, which I\nhave now forgotten, gave offense to the Assembly. He was taken up,\ncensur'd, and imprison'd for a month, by the speaker's warrant, I\nsuppose, because he would not discover his author. I too was taken up\nand examin'd before the council; but, tho' I did not give them any\nsatisfaction, they contented themselves with admonishing me, and\ndismissed me, considering me, perhaps, as an apprentice, who was bound\nto keep his master's secrets.\n\nDuring my brother's confinement, which I resented a good deal,\nnotwithstanding our private differences, I had the management of the\npaper; and I made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it, which my\nbrother took very kindly, while others began to consider me in an\nunfavorable light, as a young genius that had a turn for libeling and\nsatyr. My brother's discharge was accompany'd with an order of the\nHouse (a very odd one), that \"_James Franklin should no longer print\nthe paper called the New England Courant_.\"\n\nThere was a consultation held in our printing-house among his friends,\nwhat he should do in this case. Some proposed to evade the order by\nchanging the name of the paper; but my brother, seeing inconveniences\nin that, it was finally concluded on as a better way, to let it be\nprinted for the future under the name of Benjamin Franklin; and to\navoid the censure of the Assembly, that might fall on him as still\nprinting it by his apprentice, the contrivance was that my old\nindenture should be return'd to me, with a full discharge on the back\nof it, to be shown on occasion, but to secure to him the benefit of my\nservice, I was to sign new indentures for the remainder of the term,\nwhich were to be kept private. A very flimsy scheme it was; however,\nit was immediately executed, and the paper went on accordingly, under\nmy name for several months.\n\nAt length, a fresh difference arising between my brother and me, I\ntook upon me to assert my freedom, presuming that he would not venture\nto produce the new indentures. It was not fair in me to take this\nadvantage, and this I therefore reckon one of the first errata of my\nlife; but the unfairness of it weighed little with me, when under the\nimpressions of resentment for the blows his passion too often urged\nhim to bestow upon me, though he was otherwise not an ill-natur'd man:\nperhaps I was too saucy and provoking.\n\nWhen he found I would leave him, he took care to prevent my getting\nemployment in any other printing-house of the town, by going round and\nspeaking to every master, who accordingly refus'd to give me work. I\nthen thought of going to New York, as the nearest place where there\nwas a printer; and I was rather inclin'd to leave Boston when I\nreflected that I had already made myself a little obnoxious to the\ngoverning party, and, from the arbitrary proceedings of the Assembly\nin my brother's case, it was likely I might, if I stay'd, soon bring\nmyself into scrapes; and farther, that my indiscreet disputations\nabout religion began to make me pointed at with horror by good people\nas an infidel or atheist. I determin'd on the point, but my father now\nsiding with my brother, I was sensible that, if I attempted to go\nopenly, means would be used to prevent me. My friend Collins,\ntherefore, undertook to manage a little for me. He agreed with the\ncaptain of a New York sloop for my passage, under the notion of my\nbeing a young acquaintance of his. So I sold some of my books to raise\na little money, was taken on board privately, and as we had a fair\nwind, in three days I found myself in New York, near 300 miles from\nhome, a boy of but 17, without the least recommendation to, or\nknowledge of, any person in the place, and with very little money in\nmy pocket.\n\n[Illustration: Sailboat]\n\nIII\n\nARRIVAL IN PHILADELPHIA\n\nMy inclinations for the sea were by this time worne out, or I might\nnow have gratify'd them. But, having a trade, and supposing myself a\npretty good workman, I offer'd my service to the printer in the place,\nold Mr. William Bradford, who had been the first printer in\nPennsylvania, but removed from thence upon the quarrel of George\nKeith. He could give me no employment, having little to do, and help\nenough already; but says he, \"My son at Philadelphia has lately lost\nhis principal hand, Aquilla Rose, by death; if you go thither, I\nbelieve he may employ you.\" Philadelphia was a hundred miles further;\nI set out, however, in a boat for Amboy, leaving my chest and things\nto follow me round by sea."

        "content": "In crossing the bay, we met with a squall that tore our rotten sails\nto pieces, prevented our getting into the Kill,[25] and drove us upon\nLong Island. In our way, a drunken Dutchman, who was a passenger too,\nfell overboard; when he was sinking, I reached through the water to\nhis shock pate, and drew him up, so that we got him in again. His\nducking sobered him a little, and he went to sleep, taking first out\nof his pocket a book, which he desir'd I would dry for him. It proved\nto be my old favorite author, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, in Dutch,\nfinely printed on good paper, with copper cuts, a dress better than I\nhad ever seen it wear in its own language. I have since found that it\nhas been translated into most of the languages of Europe, and suppose\nit has been more generally read than any other book, except perhaps\nthe Bible. Honest John was the first that I know of who mix'd\nnarration and dialogue; a method of writing very engaging to the\nreader, who in the most interesting parts finds himself, as it were,\nbrought into the company and present at the discourse. De Foe in his\nCruso, his Moll Flanders, Religious Courtship, Family Instructor, and\nother pieces, has imitated it with success; and Richardson[26] has done\nthe same in his Pamela, etc.\n\n[25] Kill van Kull, the channel separating Staten Island\nfrom New Jersey on the north.\n\n[26] Samuel Richardson, the father of the English novel,\nwrote _Pamela_, _Clarissa Harlowe_, and the _History of\nSir Charles Grandison_, novels published in the form of\nletters.\n\nWhen we drew near the island, we found it was at a place where there\ncould be no landing, there being a great surff on the stony beach. So\nwe dropt anchor, and swung round towards the shore. Some people came\ndown to the water edge and hallow'd to us, as we did to them; but the\nwind was so high, and the surff so loud, that we could not hear so as\nto understand each other. There were canoes on the shore, and we made\nsigns, and hallow'd that they should fetch us; but they either did not\nunderstand us, or thought it impracticable, so they went away, and\nnight coming on, we had no remedy but to wait till the wind should\nabate; and, in the meantime, the boatman and I concluded to sleep, if\nwe could; and so crowded into the scuttle, with the Dutchman, who was\nstill wet, and the spray beating over the head of our boat, leak'd\nthro' to us, so that we were soon almost as wet as he. In this manner\nwe lay all night, with very little rest; but, the wind abating the\nnext day, we made a shift to reach Amboy before night, having been\nthirty hours on the water, without victuals, or any drink but a bottle\nof filthy rum, and the water we sail'd on being salt.\n\nIn the evening I found myself very feverish, and went in to bed; but,\nhaving read somewhere that cold water drank plentifully was good for a\nfever, I follow'd the prescription, sweat plentifully most of the\nnight, my fever left me, and in the morning, crossing the ferry, I\nproceeded on my journey on foot, having fifty miles to Burlington,\nwhere I was told I should find boats that would carry me the rest of\nthe way to Philadelphia.\n\n[Illustration: It rained very hard all the day]\n\nIt rained very hard all the day; I was thoroughly soak'd, and by noon\na good deal tired; so I stopt at a poor inn, where I staid all night,\nbeginning now to wish that I had never left home. I cut so miserable a\nfigure, too, that I found, by the questions ask'd me, I was suspected\nto be some runaway servant, and in danger of being taken up on that\nsuspicion. However, I proceeded the next day, and got in the evening\nto an inn, within eight or ten miles of Burlington, kept by one Dr.\nBrown. He entered into conversation with me while I took some\nrefreshment, and, finding I had read a little, became very sociable\nand friendly. Our acquaintance continu'd as long as he liv'd. He had\nbeen, I imagine, an itinerant doctor, for there was no town in\nEngland, or country in Europe, of which he could not give a very\nparticular account. He had some letters, and was ingenious, but much\nof an unbeliever, and wickedly undertook, some years after, to\ntravesty the Bible in doggrel verse, as Cotton had done Virgil. By\nthis means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light, and\nmight have hurt weak minds if his work had been published; but it\nnever was.\n\nAt his house I lay that night, and the next morning reach'd\nBurlington, but had the mortification to find that the regular boats\nwere gone a little before my coming, and no other expected to go\nbefore Tuesday, this being Saturday; wherefore I returned to an old\nwoman in the town, of whom I had bought gingerbread to eat on the\nwater, and ask'd her advice. She invited me to lodge at her house till\na passage by water should offer; and being tired with my foot\ntraveling, I accepted the invitation. She understanding I was a\nprinter, would have had me stay at that town and follow my business,\nbeing ignorant of the stock necessary to begin with. She was very\nhospitable, gave me a dinner of ox-cheek with great good will,\naccepting only of a pot of ale in return; and I thought myself fixed\ntill Tuesday should come. However, walking in the evening by the side\nof the river, a boat came by, which I found was going towards\nPhiladelphia, with several people in her. They took me in, and, as\nthere was no wind, we row'd all the way; and about midnight, not\nhaving yet seen the city, some of the company were confident we must\nhave passed it, and would row no farther; the others knew not where we\nwere; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek, landed near an old\nfence, with the rails of which we made a fire, the night being cold,\nin October, and there we remained till daylight. Then one of the\ncompany knew the place to be Cooper's Creek, a little above\nPhiladelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek, and\narriv'd there about eight or nine o'clock on the Sunday morning, and\nlanded at the Market-street wharf.\n\nI have been the more particular in this description of my journey, and\nshall be so of my first entry into that city, that you may in your\nmind compare such unlikely beginnings with the figure I have since\nmade there. I was in my working dress, my best clothes being to come\nround by sea. I was dirty from my journey; my pockets were stuff'd out\nwith shirts and stockings, and I knew no soul nor where to look for\nlodging. I was fatigued with traveling, rowing, and want of rest, I\nwas very hungry; and my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch\ndollar, and about a shilling in copper. The latter I gave the people\nof the boat for my passage, who at first refus'd it, on account of my\nrowing; but I insisted on their taking it. A man being sometimes more\ngenerous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty,\nperhaps thro' fear of being thought to have but little."

        "content": "Then I walked up the street, gazing about till near the market-house I\nmet a boy with bread. I had made many a meal on bread, and, inquiring\nwhere he got it, I went immediately to the baker's he directed me to,\nin Second-street, and ask'd for bisket, intending such as we had in\nBoston; but they, it seems, were not made in Philadelphia. Then I\nasked for a three-penny loaf, and was told they had none such. So not\nconsidering or knowing the difference of money, and the greater\ncheapness nor the names of his bread, I bade him give me three-penny\nworth of any sort. He gave me, accordingly, three great puffy rolls. I\nwas surpris'd at the quantity, but took it, and, having no room in my\npockets, walk'd off with a roll under each arm, and eating the other.\nThus I went up Market-street as far as Fourth-street, passing by the\ndoor of Mr. Read, my future wife's father; when she, standing at the\ndoor, saw me, and thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward,\nridiculous appearance. Then I turned and went down Chestnut-street and\npart of Walnut-street, eating my roll all the way, and, coming round,\nfound myself again at Market-street wharf, near the boat I came in, to\nwhich I went for a draught of the river water; and, being filled with\none of my rolls, gave the other two to a woman and her child that came\ndown the river in the boat with us, and were waiting to go farther.\n\n[Illustration: \"She, standing at the door, saw me, and thought I made,\nas I certainly did, a most awkward, ridiculous appearance\"]\n\nThus refreshed, I walked again up the street, which by this time had\nmany clean-dressed people in it, who were all walking the same way. I\njoined them, and thereby was led into the great meeting-house of the\nQuakers near the market. I sat down among them, and, after looking round\nawhile and hearing nothing said, being very drowsy thro' labour and want\nof rest the preceding night, I fell fast asleep, and continu'd so till\nthe meeting broke up, when one was kind enough to rouse me. This was,\ntherefore, the first house I was in, or slept in, in Philadelphia.\n\nWalking down again toward the river, and, looking in the faces of\npeople, I met a young Quaker man, whose countenance I lik'd, and,\naccosting him, requested he would tell me where a stranger could get\nlodging. We were then near the sign of the Three Mariners. \"Here,\"\nsays he, \"is one place that entertains strangers, but it is not a\nreputable house; if thee wilt walk with me, I'll show thee a better.\"\nHe brought me to the Crooked Billet in Water-street. Here I got a\ndinner; and, while I was eating it, several sly questions were asked\nme, as it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance, that I\nmight be some runaway.\n\nAfter dinner, my sleepiness return'd, and being shown to a bed, I lay\ndown without undressing, and slept till six in the evening, was call'd\nto supper, went to bed again very early, and slept soundly till next\nmorning. Then I made myself as tidy as I could, and went to Andrew\nBradford the printer's. I found in the shop the old man his father,\nwhom I had seen at New York, and who, traveling on horseback, had got\nto Philadelphia before me. He introduc'd me to his son, who receiv'd\nme civilly, gave me a breakfast, but told me he did not at present\nwant a hand, being lately suppli'd with one; but there was another\nprinter in town, lately set up, one Keimer, who, perhaps, might employ\nme; if not, I should be welcome to lodge at his house, and he would\ngive me a little work to do now and then till fuller business should\noffer.\n\nThe old gentleman said he would go with me to the new printer; and\nwhen we found him, \"Neighbour,\" says Bradford, \"I have brought to see\nyou a young man of your business; perhaps you may want such a one.\" He\nask'd me a few questions, put a composing stick in my hand to see how\nI work'd, and then said he would employ me soon, though he had just\nthen nothing for me to do; and, taking old Bradford, whom he had never\nseen before, to be one of the town's people that had a good will for\nhim, enter'd into a conversation on his present undertaking and\nprospects; while Bradford, not discovering that he was the other\nprinter's father, on Keimer's saying he expected soon to get the\ngreatest part of the business into his own hands, drew him on by\nartful questions, and starting little doubts, to explain all his\nviews, what interest he reli'd on, and in what manner he intended to\nproceed. I, who stood by and heard all, saw immediately that one of\nthem was a crafty old sophister, and the other a mere novice. Bradford\nleft me with Keimer, who was greatly surpris'd when I told him who the\nold man was.\n\nKeimer's printing-house, I found, consisted of an old shatter'd press,\nand one small, worn-out font of English, which he was then using\nhimself, composing an Elegy on Aquilla Rose, before mentioned, an\ningenious young man, of excellent character, much respected in the\ntown, clerk of the Assembly, and a pretty poet. Keimer made verses\ntoo, but very indifferently. He could not be said to write them, for\nhis manner was to compose them in the types directly out of his head.\nSo there being no copy,[27] but one pair of cases, and the Elegy likely\nto require all the letter, no one could help him. I endeavour'd to put\nhis press (which he had not yet us'd, and of which he understood\nnothing) into order fit to be work'd with; and, promising to come and\nprint off his Elegy as soon as he should have got it ready, I\nreturn'd to Bradford's, who gave me a little job to do for the\npresent, and there I lodged and dieted. A few days after, Keimer sent\nfor me to print off the Elegy. And now he had got another pair of\ncases,[28] and a pamphlet to reprint, on which he set me to work.\n\nThese two printers I found poorly qualified for their business.\nBradford had not been bred to it, and was very illiterate; and Keimer,\ntho' something of a scholar, was a mere compositor, knowing nothing of\npresswork. He had been one of the French prophets,[29] and could act\ntheir enthusiastic agitations. At this time he did not profess any\nparticular religion, but something of all on occasion; was very\nignorant of the world, and had, as I afterward found, a good deal of\nthe knave in his composition. He did not like my lodging at Bradford's\nwhile I work'd with him. He had a house, indeed, but without\nfurniture, so he could not lodge me; but he got me a lodging at Mr.\nRead's before mentioned, who was the owner of his house; and, my chest\nand clothes being come by this time, I made rather a more respectable\nappearance in the eyes of Miss Read than I had done when she first\nhappen'd to see me eating my roll in the street.\n\n[27] Manuscript.\n\n[28] The frames for holding type are in two sections, the\nupper for capitals and the lower for small letters.\n\n[29] Protestants of the South of France, who became\nfanatical under the persecutions of Louis XIV, and\nthought they had the gift of prophecy.

        "content": "I began now to have some acquaintance among the young people of the\ntown, that were lovers of reading, with whom I spent my evenings very\npleasantly; and gaining money by my industry and frugality, I lived\nvery agreeably, forgetting Boston as much as I could, and not desiring\nthat any there should know where I resided, except my friend Collins,\nwho was in my secret, and kept it when I wrote to him. At length, an\nincident happened that sent me back again much sooner than I had\nintended. I had a brother-in-law, Robert Holmes, master of a sloop\nthat traded between Boston and Delaware. He being at Newcastle, forty\nmiles below Philadelphia, heard there of me, and wrote me a letter\nmentioning the concern of my friends in Boston at my abrupt departure,\nassuring me of their good will to me, and that everything would be\naccommodated to my mind if I would return, to which he exhorted me\nvery earnestly. I wrote an answer to his letter, thank'd him for his\nadvice, but stated my reasons for quitting Boston fully and in such a\nlight as to convince him I was not so wrong as he had apprehended.\n\nIV\n\nFIRST VISIT TO BOSTON\n\nSir William Keith, governor of the province, was then at Newcastle,\nand Captain Holmes, happening to be in company with him when my letter\ncame to hand, spoke to him of me, and show'd him the letter. The\ngovernor read it, and seem'd surpris'd when he was told my age. He\nsaid I appear'd a young man of promising parts, and therefore should\nbe encouraged; the printers at Philadelphia were wretched ones; and,\nif I would set up there, he made no doubt I should succeed; for his\npart, he would procure me the public business, and do me every other\nservice in his power. This my brother-in-law afterwards told me in\nBoston, but I knew as yet nothing of it; when, one day, Keimer and I\nbeing at work together near the window, we saw the governor and\nanother gentleman (which proved to be Colonel French, of Newcastle),\nfinely dress'd, come directly across the street to our house, and\nheard them at the door.\n\nKeimer ran down immediately, thinking it a visit to him; but the\ngovernor inquir'd for me, came up, and with a condescension and\npoliteness I had been quite unus'd to, made me many compliments,\ndesired to be acquainted with me, blam'd me kindly for not having made\nmyself known to him when I first came to the place, and would have me\naway with him to the tavern, where he was going with Colonel French to\ntaste, as he said, some excellent Madeira. I was not a little\nsurprised, and Keimer star'd like a pig poison'd.[30] I went, however,\nwith the governor and Colonel French to a tavern, at the corner of\nThird-street, and over the Madeira he propos'd my setting up my\nbusiness, laid before me the probabilities of success, and both he and\nColonel French assur'd me I should have their interest and influence\nin procuring the public business of both governments.[31] On my\ndoubting whether my father would assist me in it, Sir William said he\nwould give me a letter to him, in which he would state the advantages,\nand he did not doubt of prevailing with him. So it was concluded I\nshould return to Boston in the first vessel, with the governor's\nletter recommending me to my father. In the meantime the intention was\nto be kept a secret, and I went on working with Keimer as usual, the\ngovernor sending for me now and then to dine with him, a very great\nhonour I thought it, and conversing with me in the most affable,\nfamiliar, and friendly manner imaginable.\n\n[30] Temple Franklin considered this specific figure\nvulgar and changed it to \"stared with astonishment.\"\n\n[31] Pennsylvania and Delaware.\n\nAbout the end of April, 1724, a little vessel offer'd for Boston. I\ntook leave of Keimer as going to see my friends. The governor gave me\nan ample letter, saying many flattering things of me to my father, and\nstrongly recommending the project of my setting up at Philadelphia as\na thing that must make my fortune. We struck on a shoal in going down\nthe bay, and sprung a leak; we had a blustering time at sea, and were\noblig'd to pump almost continually, at which I took my turn. We\narriv'd safe, however, at Boston in about a fortnight. I had been\nabsent seven months, and my friends had heard nothing of me; for my\nbr. Holmes was not yet return'd, and had not written about me. My\nunexpected appearance surpris'd the family; all were, however, very\nglad to see me, and made me welcome, except my brother. I went to see\nhim at his printing-house. I was better dress'd than ever while in his\nservice, having a genteel new suit from head to foot, a watch, and my\npockets lin'd with near five pounds sterling in silver. He receiv'd me\nnot very frankly, look'd me all over, and turn'd to his work again.\n\n[Illustration: The journeymen were inquisitive]\n\nThe journeymen were inquisitive where I had been, what sort of a\ncountry it was, and how I lik'd it. I prais'd it much, and the happy\nlife I led in it, expressing strongly my intention of returning to it;\nand, one of them asking what kind of money we had there, I produc'd a\nhandful of silver, and spread it before them, which was a kind of\nraree-show[32] they had not been us'd to, paper being the money of\nBoston.[33] Then I took an opportunity of letting them see my watch;\nand, lastly (my brother still grum and sullen), I gave them a piece\nof eight[34] to drink, and took my leave. This visit of mine offended\nhim extreamly; for, when my mother some time after spoke to him of a\nreconciliation, and of her wishes to see us on good terms together,\nand that we might live for the future as brothers, he said I had\ninsulted him in such a manner before his people that he could never\nforget or forgive it. In this, however, he was mistaken.\n\n[32] A peep-show in a box.\n\n[33] There were no mints in the colonies, so the metal\nmoney was of foreign coinage and not nearly so common as\npaper money, which was printed in large quantities in\nAmerica, even in small denominations.\n\n[34] Spanish dollar about equivalent to our dollar.\n\nMy father received the governor's letter with some apparent surprise,\nbut said little of it to me for some days, when Capt. Holmes returning\nhe show'd it to him, asked him if he knew Keith, and what kind of man\nhe was; adding his opinion that he must be of small discretion to\nthink of setting a boy up in business who wanted yet three years of\nbeing at man's estate. Holmes said what he could in favour of the\nproject, but my father was clear in the impropriety of it, and at\nlast, gave a flat denial to it. Then he wrote a civil letter to Sir\nWilliam, thanking him for the patronage he had so kindly offered me,\nbut declining to assist me as yet in setting up, I being, in his\nopinion, too young to be trusted with the management of a business so\nimportant, and for which the preparation must be so expensive.\n\nMy friend and companion Collins, who was a clerk in the post-office,\npleas'd with the account I gave him of my new country, determined to\ngo thither also; and, while I waited for my father's determination, he\nset out before me by land to Rhode Island, leaving his books, which\nwere a pretty collection of mathematicks and natural philosophy, to\ncome with mine and me to New York, where he propos'd to wait for me."

This afterwards occasion'd me a good deal of\nuneasiness.\n\nAt Newport we took in a number of passengers for New York, among\nwhich were two young women, companions, and a grave, sensible,\nmatronlike Quaker woman, with her attendants. I had shown an obliging\nreadiness to do her some little services, which impress'd her I\nsuppose with a degree of good will toward me; therefore, when she saw\na daily growing familiarity between me and the two young women, which\nthey appear'd to encourage, she took me aside, and said, \"Young man, I\nam concern'd for thee, as thou hast no friend with thee, and seems not\nto know much of the world, or of the snares youth is expos'd to;\ndepend upon it, those are very bad women; I can see it in all their\nactions; and if thee art not upon thy guard, they will draw thee into\nsome danger; they are strangers to thee, and I advise thee, in a\nfriendly concern for thy welfare, to have no acquaintance with them.\"\nAs I seem'd at first not to think so ill of them as she did, she\nmentioned some things she had observ'd and heard that had escap'd my\nnotice, but now convinc'd me she was right. I thank'd her for her kind\nadvice, and promis'd to follow it. When we arriv'd at New York, they\ntold me where they liv'd, and invited me to come and see them; but I\navoided it, and it was well I did; for the next day the captain miss'd\na silver spoon and some other things, that had been taken out of his\ncabin, and, knowing that these were a couple of strumpets, he got a\nwarrant to search their lodgings, found the stolen goods, and had the\nthieves punish'd. So, tho' we had escap'd a sunken rock, which we\nscrap'd upon in the passage, I thought this escape of rather more\nimportance to me.\n\nAt New York I found my friend Collins, who had arriv'd there some time\nbefore me. We had been intimate from children, and had read the same\nbooks together; but he had the advantage of more time for reading and\nstudying, and a wonderful genius for mathematical learning, in which\nhe far outstript me. While I liv'd in Boston, most of my hours of\nleisure for conversation were spent with him, and he continu'd a sober\nas well as an industrious lad; was much respected for his learning by\nseveral of the clergy and other gentlemen, and seemed to promise\nmaking a good figure in life. But, during my absence, he had acquir'd\na habit of sotting with brandy; and I found by his own account, and\nwhat I heard from others, that he had been drunk every day since his\narrival at New York, and behav'd very oddly. He had gam'd, too, and\nlost his money, so that I was oblig'd to discharge his lodgings, and\ndefray his expenses to and at Philadelphia, which prov'd extremely\ninconvenient to me.\n\nThe then governor of New York, Burnet (son of Bishop Burnet), hearing\nfrom the captain that a young man, one of his passengers, had a great\nmany books, desir'd he would bring me to see him. I waited upon him\naccordingly, and should have taken Collins with me but that he was not\nsober. The gov'r. treated me with great civility, show'd me his\nlibrary, which was a very large one, and we had a good deal of\nconversation about books and authors. This was the second governor who\nhad done me the honour to take notice of me; which, to a poor boy like\nme, was very pleasing.\n\nWe proceeded to Philadelphia. I received on the way Vernon's money,\nwithout which we could hardly have finish'd our journey. Collins\nwished to be employ'd in some counting-house; but, whether they\ndiscover'd his dramming by his breath, or by his behaviour, tho' he\nhad some recommendations, he met with no success in any application,\nand continu'd lodging and boarding at the same house with me, and at\nmy expense. Knowing I had that money of Vernon's, he was continually\nborrowing of me, still promising repayment as soon as he should be in\nbusiness. At length he had got so much of it that I was distress'd to\nthink what I should do in case of being call'd on to remit it.\n\nHis drinking continu'd, about which we sometimes quarrel'd; for, when\na little intoxicated, he was very fractious. Once, in a boat on the\nDelaware with some other young men, he refused to row in his turn. \"I\nwill be row'd home,\" says he. \"We will not row you,\" says I. \"You\nmust, or stay all night on the water,\" says he, \"just as you please.\"\nThe others said, \"Let us row; what signifies it?\" But, my mind being\nsoured with his other conduct, I continu'd to refuse. So he swore he\nwould make me row, or throw me overboard; and coming along, stepping\non the thwarts, toward me, when he came up and struck at me, I clapped\nmy hand under his crutch, and, rising, pitched him head-foremost into\nthe river. I knew he was a good swimmer, and so was under little\nconcern about him; but before he could get round to lay hold of the\nboat, we had with a few strokes pull'd her out of his reach; and ever\nwhen he drew near the boat, we ask'd if he would row, striking a few\nstrokes to slide her away from him. He was ready to die with\nvexation, and obstinately would not promise to row. However, seeing\nhim at last beginning to tire, we lifted him in and brought him home\ndripping wet in the evening. We hardly exchang'd a civil word\nafterwards, and a West India captain, who had a commission to procure\na tutor for the sons of a gentleman at Barbados, happening to meet\nwith him, agreed to carry him thither. He left me then, promising to\nremit me the first money he should receive in order to discharge the\ndebt; but I never heard of him after."

        "content": "The breaking into this money of Vernon's was one of the first great\nerrata of my life; and this affair show'd that my father was not much\nout in his judgment when he suppos'd me too young to manage business\nof importance. But Sir William, on reading his letter, said he was too\nprudent. There was great difference in persons; and discretion did not\nalways accompany years, nor was youth always without it. \"And since he\nwill not set you up,\" says he, \"I will do it myself. Give me an\ninventory of the things necessary to be had from England, and I will\nsend for them. You shall repay me when you are able; I am resolv'd to\nhave a good printer here, and I am sure you must succeed.\" This was\nspoken with such an appearance of cordiality, that I had not the least\ndoubt of his meaning what he said. I had hitherto kept the proposition\nof my setting up, a secret in Philadelphia, and I still kept it. Had\nit been known that I depended on the governor, probably some friend,\nthat knew him better, would have advis'd me not to rely on him, as I\nafterwards heard it as his known character to be liberal of promises\nwhich he never meant to keep. Yet, unsolicited as he was by me, how\ncould I think his generous offers insincere? I believ'd him one of the\nbest men in the world.\n\nI presented him an inventory of a little print'-house, amounting by my\ncomputation to about one hundred pounds sterling. He lik'd it, but\nask'd me if my being on the spot in England to chuse the types, and\nsee that everything was good of the kind, might not be of some\nadvantage. \"Then,\" says he, \"when there, you may make acquaintances,\nand establish correspondences in the bookselling and stationery way.\"\nI agreed that this might be advantageous. \"Then,\" says he, \"get\nyourself ready to go with Annis;\" which was the annual ship, and the\nonly one at that time usually passing between London and Philadelphia.\nBut it would be some months before Annis sail'd, so I continued\nworking with Keimer, fretting about the money Collins had got from me,\nand in daily apprehensions of being call'd upon by Vernon, which,\nhowever, did not happen for some years after.\n\nI believe I have omitted mentioning that, in my first voyage from\nBoston, being becalm'd off Block Island, our people set about catching\ncod, and hauled up a great many. Hitherto I had stuck to my resolution\nof not eating animal food, and on this occasion I consider'd, with my\nmaster Tryon, the taking every fish as a kind of unprovoked murder,\nsince none of them had, or ever could do us any injury that might\njustify the slaughter. All this seemed very reasonable. But I had\nformerly been a great lover of fish, and, when this came hot out of\nthe frying-pan, it smelt admirably well. I balanc'd some time between\nprinciple and inclination, till I recollected that, when the fish were\nopened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought\nI, \"If you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you.\" So I\ndin'd upon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people,\nreturning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet. So\nconvenient a thing is it to be a _reasonable creature_, since it\nenables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to\ndo.\n\nV\n\nEARLY FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA\n\nKeimer and I liv'd on a pretty good familiar footing, and agreed\ntolerably well, for he suspected nothing of my setting up. He retained\na great deal of his old enthusiasms and lov'd argumentation. We\ntherefore had many disputations. I used to work him so with my\nSocratic method, and had trepann'd him so often by questions\napparently so distant from any point we had in hand, and yet by\ndegrees led to the point, and brought him into difficulties and\ncontradictions, that at last he grew ridiculously cautious, and would\nhardly answer me the most common question, without asking first,\n\"_What do you intend to infer from that_?\" However, it gave him so\nhigh an opinion of my abilities in the confuting way, that he\nseriously proposed my being his colleague in a project he had of\nsetting up a new sect. He was to preach the doctrines, and I was to\nconfound all opponents. When he came to explain with me upon the\ndoctrines, I found several conundrums which I objected to, unless I\nmight have my way a little too, and introduce some of mine.\n\nKeimer wore his beard at full length, because somewhere in the Mosaic\nlaw it is said, \"_Thou shalt not mar the corners of thy beard_.\" He\nlikewise kept the Seventh day, Sabbath; and these two points were\nessentials with him. I dislik'd both; but agreed to admit them upon\ncondition of his adopting the doctrine of using no animal food. \"I\ndoubt,\" said he, \"my constitution will not bear that.\" I assur'd him\nit would, and that he would be the better for it. He was usually a\ngreat glutton, and I promised myself some diversion in half starving\nhim. He agreed to try the practice, if I would keep him company. I did\nso, and we held it for three months. We had our victuals dress'd, and\nbrought to us regularly by a woman in the neighborhood, who had from\nme a list of forty dishes, to be prepar'd for us at different times,\nin all which there was neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, and the whim\nsuited me the better at this time from the cheapness of it, not\ncosting us above eighteenpence sterling each per week. I have since\nkept several Lents most strictly, leaving the common diet for that,\nand that for the common, abruptly, without the least inconvenience, so\nthat I think there is little in the advice of making those changes by\neasy gradations. I went on pleasantly, but poor Keimer suffered\ngrievously, tired of the project, long'd for the flesh-pots of Egypt,\nand order'd a roast pig. He invited me and two women friends to dine\nwith him; but, it being brought too soon upon table, he could not\nresist the temptation, and ate the whole before we came.\n\nI had made some courtship during this time to Miss Read. I had a great\nrespect and affection for her, and had some reason to believe she had\nthe same for me; but, as I was about to take a long voyage, and we\nwere both very young, only a little above eighteen, it was thought\nmost prudent by her mother to prevent our going too far at present, as\na marriage, if it was to take place, would be more convenient after my\nreturn, when I should be, as I expected, set up in my business.\nPerhaps, too, she thought my expectations not so well founded as I\nimagined them to be.\n\nMy chief acquaintances at this time were Charles Osborne, Joseph\nWatson, and James Ralph, all lovers of reading. The two first were\nclerks to an eminent scrivener or conveyancer in the town, Charles\nBrockden; the other was clerk to a merchant. Watson was a pious,\nsensible young man, of great integrity; the others rather more lax in\ntheir principles of religion, particularly Ralph, who, as well as\nCollins, had been unsettled by me, for which they both made me suffer.\nOsborne was sensible, candid, frank; sincere and affectionate to his\nfriends; but, in literary matters, too fond of criticizing. Ralph was\ningenious, genteel in his manners, and extremely eloquent; I think I\nnever knew a prettier talker. Both of them were great admirers of\npoetry, and began to try their hands in little pieces. Many pleasant\nwalks we four had together on Sundays into the woods, near\nSchuylkill, where we read to one another, and conferr'd on what we\nread.\n\n[Illustration: \"Many pleasant walks we four had together\"]"

        "content": "Ralph was inclin'd to pursue the study of poetry, not doubting but he\nmight become eminent in it, and make his fortune by it, alleging that\nthe best poets must, when they first began to write, make as many\nfaults as he did. Osborne dissuaded him, assur'd him he had no genius\nfor poetry, and advis'd him to think of nothing beyond the business he\nwas bred to; that, in the mercantile way, tho' he had no stock, he\nmight, by his diligence and punctuality, recommend himself to\nemployment as a factor, and in time acquire wherewith to trade on his\nown account. I approv'd the amusing one's self with poetry now and\nthen, so far as to improve one's language, but no farther.\n\nOn this it was propos'd that we should each of us, at our next\nmeeting, produce a piece of our own composing, in order to improve by\nour mutual observations, criticisms, and corrections. As language and\nexpression were what we had in view, we excluded all considerations of\ninvention by agreeing that the task should be a version of the\neighteenth Psalm, which describes the descent of a Deity. When the\ntime of our meeting drew nigh, Ralph called on me first, and let me\nknow his piece was ready. I told him I had been busy, and, having\nlittle inclination, had done nothing. He then show'd me his piece for\nmy opinion, and I much approv'd it, as it appear'd to me to have great\nmerit. \"Now,\" says he, \"Osborne never will allow the least merit in\nanything of mine, but makes 1000 criticisms out of mere envy. He is\nnot so jealous of you; I wish, therefore, you would take this piece,\nand produce it as yours; I will pretend not to have had time, and so\nproduce nothing. We shall then see what he will say to it.\" It was\nagreed, and I immediately transcrib'd it, that it might appear in my\nown hand.\n\nWe met; Watson's performance was read; there were some beauties in it,\nbut many defects. Osborne's was read; it was much better; Ralph did it\njustice; remarked some faults, but applauded the beauties. He himself\nhad nothing to produce. I was backward; seemed desirous of being\nexcused; had not had sufficient time to correct, etc.; but no excuse\ncould be admitted; produce I must. It was read and repeated; Watson\nand Osborne gave up the contest, and join'd in applauding it. Ralph\nonly made some criticisms, and propos'd some amendments; but I\ndefended my text. Osborne was against Ralph, and told him he was no\nbetter a critic than poet, so he dropt the argument. As they two went\nhome together, Osborne expressed himself still more strongly in favor\nof what he thought my production; having restrain'd himself before, as\nhe said, lest I should think it flattery. \"But who would have\nimagin'd,\" said he, \"that Franklin had been capable of such a\nperformance; such painting, such force, such fire! He has even\nimprov'd the original. In his common conversation he seems to have no\nchoice of words; he hesitates and blunders; and yet, good God! how he\nwrites!\" When we next met, Ralph discovered the trick we had plaid\nhim, and Osborne was a little laughed at.\n\nThis transaction fixed Ralph in his resolution of becoming a poet. I\ndid all I could to dissuade him from it, but he continued scribbling\nverses till _Pope_ cured him.[35] He became, however, a pretty good\nprose writer. More of him hereafter. But, as I may not have occasion\nagain to mention the other two, I shall just remark here, that Watson\ndied in my arms a few years after, much lamented, being the best of\nour set. Osborne went to the West Indies, where he became an eminent\nlawyer and made money, but died young. He and I had made a serious\nagreement, that the one who happen'd first to die should, if possible,\nmake a friendly visit to the other, and acquaint him how he found\nthings in that separate state. But he never fulfill'd his promise.\n\n[35] \"In one of the later editions of the _Dunciad_ occur\nthe following lines:\n\n'Silence, ye wolves! while Ralph to Cynthia howls,\nAnd makes night hideous--answer him, ye owls.'\n\nTo this the poet adds the following note:\n\n'James Ralph, a name inserted after the first editions,\nnot known till he writ a swearing-piece called _Sawney_,\nvery abusive of Dr. Swift, Mr. Gay, and myself.'\"\n\nVI\n\nFIRST VISIT TO LONDON\n\nThe governor, seeming to like my company, had me frequently to his\nhouse, and his setting me up was always mention'd as a fixed thing. I\nwas to take with me letters recommendatory to a number of his friends,\nbesides the letter of credit to furnish me with the necessary money\nfor purchasing the press and types, paper, etc. For these letters I\nwas appointed to call at different times, when they were to be ready;\nbut a future time was still named. Thus he went on till the ship,\nwhose departure too had been several times postponed, was on the point\nof sailing. Then, when I call'd to take my leave and receive the\nletters, his secretary, Dr. Bard, came out to me and said the governor\nwas extremely busy in writing, but would be down at Newcastle, before\nthe ship, and there the letters would be delivered to me.\n\nRalph, though married, and having one child, had determined to\naccompany me in this voyage. It was thought he intended to establish a\ncorrespondence, and obtain goods to sell on commission; but I found\nafterwards, that, thro' some discontent with his wife's relations, he\npurposed to leave her on their hands, and never return again. Having\ntaken leave of my friends, and interchang'd some promises with Miss\nRead, I left Philadelphia in the ship, which anchor'd at Newcastle.\nThe governor was there; but when I went to his lodging, the secretary\ncame to me from him with the civillest message in the world, that he\ncould not then see me, being engaged in business of the utmost\nimportance, but should send the letters to me on board, wished me\nheartily a good voyage and a speedy return, etc. I returned on board a\nlittle puzzled, but still not doubting.\n\nMr. Andrew Hamilton, a famous lawyer of Philadelphia, had taken\npassage in the same ship for himself and son, and with Mr. Denham, a\nQuaker merchant, and Messrs. Onion and Russel, masters of an iron work\nin Maryland, had engaged the great cabin; so that Ralph and I were\nforced to take up with a berth in the steerage, and none on board\nknowing us, were considered as ordinary persons. But Mr. Hamilton and\nhis son (it was James, since governor) return'd from Newcastle to\nPhiladelphia, the father being recall'd by a great fee to plead for a\nseized ship; and, just before we sail'd, Colonel French coming on\nboard, and showing me great respect, I was more taken notice of, and,\nwith my friend Ralph, invited by the other gentlemen to come into the\ncabin, there being now room. Accordingly, we remov'd thither.\n\nUnderstanding that Colonel French had brought on board the governor's\ndespatches, I ask'd the captain for those letters that were to be\nunder my care. He said all were put into the bag together and he could\nnot then come at them; but, before we landed in England, I should have\nan opportunity of picking them out; so I was satisfied for the\npresent, and we proceeded on our voyage. We had a sociable company in\nthe cabin, and lived uncommonly well, having the addition of all Mr.\nHamilton's stores, who had laid in plentifully. In this passage Mr.\nDenham contracted a friendship for me that continued during his life.\nThe voyage was otherwise not a pleasant one, as we had a great deal of\nbad weather."

        "content": "When we came into the Channel, the captain kept his word with me, and\ngave me an opportunity of examining the bag for the governor's\nletters. I found none upon which my name was put as under my care. I\npicked out six or seven, that, by the handwriting, I thought might be\nthe promised letters, especially as one of them was directed to\nBasket, the king's printer, and another to some stationer. We arriv'd\nin London the 24th of December, 1724. I waited upon the stationer, who\ncame first in my way, delivering the letter as from Governor Keith. \"I\ndon't know such a person,\" says he; but, opening the letter, \"O! this\nis from Riddlesden. I have lately found him to be a compleat rascal,\nand I will have nothing to do with him, nor receive any letters from\nhim.\" So, putting the letter into my hand, he turn'd on his heel and\nleft me to serve some customer. I was surprized to find these were not\nthe governor's letters; and, after recollecting and comparing\ncircumstances, I began to doubt his sincerity. I found my friend\nDenham, and opened the whole affair to him. He let me into Keith's\ncharacter; told me there was not the least probability that he had\nwritten any letters for me; that no one, who knew him, had the\nsmallest dependence on him; and he laught at the notion of the\ngovernor's giving me a letter of credit, having, as he said, no credit\nto give. On my expressing some concern about what I should do, he\nadvised me to endeavour getting some employment in the way of my\nbusiness. \"Among the printers here,\" said he, \"you will improve\nyourself, and when you return to America, you will set up to greater\nadvantage.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"So, putting the letter into my hand\"]\n\nWe both of us happen'd to know, as well as the stationer, that\nRiddlesden, the attorney, was a very knave. He had half ruin'd Miss\nRead's father by persuading him to be bound for him. By this letter it\nappear'd there was a secret scheme on foot to the prejudice of\nHamilton (suppos'd to be then coming over with us); and that Keith was\nconcerned in it with Riddlesden. Denham, who was a friend of\nHamilton's, thought he ought to be acquainted with it; so, when he\narriv'd in England, which was soon after, partly from resentment and\nill-will to Keith and Riddlesden, and partly from good-will to him, I\nwaited on him, and gave him the letter. He thank'd me cordially, the\ninformation being of importance to him; and from that time he became\nmy friend, greatly to my advantage afterwards on many occasions.\n\nBut what shall we think of a governor's playing such pitiful tricks,\nand imposing so grossly on a poor ignorant boy! It was a habit he had\nacquired. He wish'd to please everybody; and, having little to give,\nhe gave expectations. He was otherwise an ingenious, sensible man, a\npretty good writer, and a good governor for the people, tho' not for\nhis constituents, the proprietaries, whose instructions he sometimes\ndisregarded. Several of our best laws were of his planning and passed\nduring his administration.\n\nRalph and I were inseparable companions. We took lodgings together in\nLittle Britain[36] at three shillings and sixpence a week--as much as\nwe could then afford. He found some relations, but they were poor, and\nunable to assist him. He now let me know his intentions of remaining\nin London, and that he never meant to return to Philadelphia. He had\nbrought no money with him, the whole he could muster having been\nexpended in paying his passage. I had fifteen pistoles;[37] so he\nborrowed occasionally of me to subsist, while he was looking out for\nbusiness. He first endeavoured to get into the play-house, believing\nhimself qualify'd for an actor; but Wilkes,[38] to whom he apply'd,\nadvis'd him candidly not to think of that employment, as it was\nimpossible he should succeed in it. Then he propos'd to Roberts, a\npublisher in Paternoster Row,[39] to write for him a weekly paper like\nthe Spectator, on certain conditions, which Roberts did not approve.\nThen he endeavoured to get employment as a hackney writer, to copy for\nthe stationers and lawyers about the Temple,[40] but could find no\nvacancy.\n\n[36] One of the oldest parts of London, north of St.\nPaul's Cathedral, called \"Little Britain\" because the\nDukes of Brittany used to live there. See the essay\nentitled \"Little Britain\" in Washington Irving's _Sketch\nBook_.\n\n[37] A gold coin worth about four dollars in our money.\n\n[38] A popular comedian, manager of Drury Lane Theater.\n\n[39] Street north of St. Paul's, occupied by publishing\nhouses.\n\n[40] Law schools and lawyers' residences situated\nsouthwest of St. Paul's, between Fleet Street and the\nThames.\n\nI immediately got into work at Palmer's, then a famous printing-house\nin Bartholomew Close, and here I continu'd near a year. I was pretty\ndiligent, but spent with Ralph a good deal of my earnings in going to\nplays and other places of amusement. We had together consumed all my\npistoles, and now just rubbed on from hand to mouth. He seem'd quite\nto forget his wife and child, and I, by degrees, my engagements with\nMiss Read, to whom I never wrote more than one letter, and that was to\nlet her know I was not likely soon to return. This was another of the\ngreat errata of my life, which I should wish to correct if I were to\nlive it over again. In fact, by our expenses, I was constantly kept\nunable to pay my passage.\n\nAt Palmer's I was employed in composing for the second edition of\nWollaston's \"Religion of Nature.\" Some of his reasonings not appearing\nto me well founded, I wrote a little metaphysical piece in which I\nmade remarks on them. It was entitled \"A Dissertation on Liberty and\nNecessity, Pleasure and Pain.\" I inscribed it to my friend Ralph; I\nprinted a small number. It occasion'd my being more consider'd by Mr.\nPalmer as a young man of some ingenuity, tho' he seriously\nexpostulated with me upon the principles of my pamphlet, which to him\nappear'd abominable. My printing this pamphlet was another erratum.\n\nWhile I lodg'd in Little Britain, I made an acquaintance with one\nWilcox, a bookseller, whose shop was at the next door. He had an\nimmense collection of second-hand books. Circulating libraries were\nnot then in use; but we agreed that, on certain reasonable terms,\nwhich I have now forgotten, I might take, read, and return any of his\nbooks. This I esteem'd a great advantage, and I made as much use of it\nas I could.\n\nMy pamphlet by some means falling into the hands of one Lyons, a\nsurgeon, author of a book entitled \"The Infallibility of Human\nJudgment,\" it occasioned an acquaintance between us. He took great\nnotice of me, called on me often to converse on those subjects,\ncarried me to the Horns, a pale alehouse in----Lane, Cheapside,\nand introduced me to Dr. Mandeville, author of the \"Fable of the\nBees,\" who had a club there, of which he was the soul, being a most\nfacetious, entertaining companion. Lyons, too, introduced me to Dr.\nPemberton, at Batson's Coffee-house, who promis'd to give me an\nopportunity, sometime or other, of seeing Sir Isaac Newton, of which I\nwas extreamly desirous; but this never happened.\n\nI had brought over a few curiosities, among which the principal was a\npurse made of the asbestos, which purifies by fire. Sir Hans Sloane\nheard of it, came to see me, and invited me to his house in Bloomsbury\nSquare, where he show'd me all his curiosities, and persuaded me to\nlet him add that to the number, for which he paid me handsomely."

She had been genteelly bred, was sensible and\nlively, and of most pleasing conversation. Ralph read plays to her in\nthe evenings, they grew intimate, she took another lodging, and he\nfollowed her. They liv'd together some time; but, he being still out\nof business, and her income not sufficient to maintain them with her\nchild, he took a resolution of going from London, to try for a country\nschool, which he thought himself well qualified to undertake, as he\nwrote an excellent hand, and was a master of arithmetic and accounts.\nThis, however, he deemed a business below him, and confident of future\nbetter fortune, when he should be unwilling to have it known that he\nonce was so meanly employed, he changed his name, and did me the\nhonour to assume mine; for I soon after had a letter from him,\nacquainting me that he was settled in a small village (in Berkshire, I\nthink it was, where he taught reading and writing to ten or a dozen\nboys, at sixpence each per week), recommending Mrs. T---- to my care,\nand desiring me to write to him, directing for Mr. Franklin,\nschoolmaster, at such a place.\n\nHe continued to write frequently, sending me large specimens of an\nepic poem which he was then composing, and desiring my remarks and\ncorrections. These I gave him from time to time, but endeavour'd\nrather to discourage his proceeding. One of Young's Satires[41] was\nthen just published. I copy'd and sent him a great part of it, which\nset in a strong light the folly of pursuing the Muses with any hope of\nadvancement by them. All was in vain; sheets of the poem continued to\ncome by every post. In the meantime, Mrs. T----, having on his account\nlost her friends and business, was often in distresses, and us'd to\nsend for me and borrow what I could spare to help her out of them. I\ngrew fond of her company, and, being at that time under no religious\nrestraint, and presuming upon my importance to her, I attempted\nfamiliarities (another erratum) which she repuls'd with a proper\nresentment, and acquainted him with my behaviour. This made a breach\nbetween us; and, when he returned again to London, he let me know he\nthought I had cancell'd all the obligations he had been under to me.\nSo I found I was never to expect his repaying me what I lent to him or\nadvanc'd for him. This, however, was not then of much consequence, as\nhe was totally unable; and in the loss of his friendship I found\nmyself relieved from a burthen. I now began to think of getting a\nlittle money beforehand, and, expecting better work, I left Palmer's\nto work at Watts's, near Lincoln's Inn Fields, a still greater\nprinting-house.[42] Here I continued all the rest of my stay in London.\n\n[41] Edward Young (1681-1765), an English poet. See his\nsatires, Vol. III, Epist. ii, page 70.\n\n[42] The printing press at which Franklin worked is\npreserved in the Patent Office at Washington.\n\nAt my first admission into this printing-house I took to working at\npress, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I had been us'd\nto in America, where presswork is mix'd with composing. I drank only\nwater; the other workmen, near fifty in number, were great guzzlers of\nbeer. On occasion, I carried up and down stairs a large form of types\nin each hand, when others carried but one in both hands. They wondered\nto see, from this and several instances, that the _Water-American_, as\nthey called me, was _stronger_ than themselves, who drank _strong_\nbeer! We had an alehouse boy who attended always in the house to\nsupply the workmen. My companion at the press drank every day a pint\nbefore breakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, a\npint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint in the\nafternoon about six o'clock, and another when he had done his day's\nwork. I thought it a detestable custom; but it was necessary, he\nsuppos'd, to drink _strong_ beer, that he might be _strong_ to labour.\nI endeavoured to convince him that the bodily strength afforded by\nbeer could only be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barley\ndissolved in the water of which it was made; that there was more flour\nin a pennyworth of bread; and therefore, if he would eat that with a\npint of water, it would give him more strength than a quart of beer.\nHe drank on, however, and had four or five shillings to pay out of his\nwages every Saturday night for that muddling liquor; an expense I was\nfree from. And thus these poor devils keep themselves always under.\n\n[Illustration: \"I took to working at press\"]\n\nWatts, after some weeks, desiring to have me in the composing-room,[43]\nI left the pressmen; a new bien venu or sum for drink, being five\nshillings, was demanded of me by the compositors. I thought it an\nimposition, as I had paid below; the master thought so too, and forbade\nmy paying it. I stood out two or three weeks, was accordingly considered\nas an excommunicate, and had so many little pieces of private mischief\ndone me, by mixing my sorts, transposing my pages, breaking my matter,\netc., etc., if I were ever so little out of the room, and all ascribed\nto the chappel ghost, which they said ever haunted those not regularly\nadmitted, that, notwithstanding the master's protection, I found myself\noblig'd to comply and pay the money, convinc'd of the folly of being on\nill terms with those one is to live with continually.\n\n[43] Franklin now left the work of operating the printing\npresses, which was largely a matter of manual labor, and\nbegan setting type, which required more skill and\nintelligence.\n\nI was now on a fair footing with them, and soon acquir'd considerable\ninfluence. I propos'd some reasonable alterations in their chappel\nlaws,[44] and carried them against all opposition. From my example, a\ngreat part of them left their muddling breakfast of beer, and bread,\nand cheese, finding they could with me be supply'd from a neighbouring\nhouse with a large porringer of hot water-gruel, sprinkled with\npepper, crumb'd with bread, and a bit of butter in it, for the price\nof a pint of beer, viz., three half-pence. This was a more comfortable\nas well as cheaper breakfast, and keep their heads clearer. Those who\ncontinued sotting with beer all day, were often, by not paying, out of\ncredit at the alehouse, and us'd to make interest with me to get beer;\ntheir _light_, as they phrased it, _being out_. I watch'd the\npay-table on Saturday night, and collected what I stood engag'd for\nthem, having to pay sometimes near thirty shillings a week on their\naccounts. This, and my being esteem'd a pretty good _riggite_, that\nis, a jocular verbal satirist, supported my consequence in the\nsociety. My constant attendance (I never making a St. Monday)[45]\nrecommended me to the master; and my uncommon quickness at composing\noccasioned my being put upon all work of dispatch, which was generally\nbetter paid. So I went on now very agreeably.\n\n[44] A printing house is called a chapel because Caxton,\nthe first English printer, did his printing in a chapel\nconnected with Westminster Abbey.\n\n[45] A holiday taken to prolong the dissipation of\nSaturday's wages."

        "content": "My lodging in Little Britain being too remote, I found another in\nDuke-street, opposite to the Romish Chapel. It was two pair of stairs\nbackwards, at an Italian warehouse. A widow lady kept the house; she\nhad a daughter, and a maid servant, and a journeyman who attended the\nwarehouse, but lodg'd abroad. After sending to inquire my character at\nthe house where I last lodg'd she agreed to take me in at the same\nrate, 3s. 6d. per week; cheaper, as she said, from the protection she\nexpected in having a man lodge in the house. She was a widow, an\nelderly woman; had been bred a Protestant, being a clergyman's\ndaughter, but was converted to the Catholic religion by her husband,\nwhose memory she much revered; had lived much among people of\ndistinction, and knew a thousand anecdotes of them as far back as the\ntimes of Charles the Second. She was lame in her knees with the gout,\nand, therefore, seldom stirred out of her room, so sometimes wanted\ncompany; and hers was so highly amusing to me, that I was sure to\nspend an evening with her whenever she desired it. Our supper was\nonly half an anchovy each, on a very little strip of bread and butter,\nand half a pint of ale between us; but the entertainment was in her\nconversation. My always keeping good hours, and giving little trouble\nin the family, made her unwilling to part with me, so that, when I\ntalk'd of a lodging I had heard of, nearer my business, for two\nshillings a week, which, intent as I now was on saving money, made\nsome difference, she bid me not think of it, for she would abate me\ntwo shillings a week for the future; so I remained with her at one\nshilling and sixpence as long as I staid in London.\n\nIn a garret of her house there lived a maiden lady of seventy, in the\nmost retired manner, of whom my landlady gave me this account: that\nshe was a Roman Catholic, had been sent abroad when young, and lodg'd\nin a nunnery with an intent of becoming a nun; but, the country not\nagreeing with her, she returned to England, where, there being no\nnunnery, she had vow'd to lead the life of a nun, as near as might be\ndone in those circumstances. Accordingly, she had given all her estate\nto charitable uses, reserving only twelve pounds a year to live on,\nand out of this sum she still gave a great deal in charity, living\nherself on water-gruel only, and using no fire but to boil it. She had\nlived many years in that garret, being permitted to remain there\ngratis by successive Catholic tenants of the house below, as they\ndeemed it a blessing to have her there. A priest visited her to\nconfess her every day. \"I have ask'd her,\" says my landlady, \"how she,\nas she liv'd, could possibly find so much employment for a confessor?\"\n\"Oh,\" said she, \"it is impossible to avoid _vain thoughts_.\" I was\npermitted once to visit her. She was cheerful and polite, and\nconvers'd pleasantly. The room was clean, but had no other furniture\nthan a matras, a table with a crucifix and book, a stool which she\ngave me to sit on, and a picture over the chimney of Saint Veronica\ndisplaying her handkerchief, with the miraculous figure of Christ's\nbleeding face on it,[46] which she explained to me with great\nseriousness. She look'd pale, but was never sick; and I give it as\nanother instance on how small an income, life and health may be\nsupported.\n\nAt Watts's printing-house I contracted an acquaintance with an\ningenious young man, one Wygate, who, having wealthy relations, had\nbeen better educated than most printers; was a tolerable Latinist,\nspoke French, and lov'd reading. I taught him and a friend of his to\nswim at twice going into the river, and they soon became good\nswimmers. They introduc'd me to some gentlemen from the country, who\nwent to Chelsea by water to see the College and Don Saltero's\ncuriosities.[47] In our return, at the request of the company, whose\ncuriosity Wygate had excited, I stripped and leaped into the river,\nand swam from near Chelsea to Blackfriar's,[48] performing on the way\nmany feats of activity, both upon and under water, that surpris'd and\npleas'd those to whom they were novelties.\n\n[46] The story is that she met Christ on His way to\ncrucifixion and offered Him her handkerchief to wipe the\nblood from His face, after which the handkerchief always\nbore the image of Christ's bleeding face.\n\n[47] James Salter, a former servant of Hans Sloane, lived\nin Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. \"His house, a barber-shop, was\nknown as 'Don Saltero's Coffee-House.' The curiosities\nwere in glass cases and constituted an amazing and\nmotley collection--a petrified crab from China, a\n'lignified hog,' Job's tears, Madagascar lances, William\nthe Conqueror's flaming sword, and Henry the Eighth's\ncoat of mail.\"--Smyth.\n\n[48] About three miles.\n\nI had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise, had studied\nand practis'd all Thevenot's motions and positions, added some of my\nown, aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the useful. All these\nI took this occasion of exhibiting to the company, and was much\nflatter'd by their admiration; and Wygate, who was desirous of\nbecoming a master, grew more and more attach'd to me on that account,\nas well as from the similarity of our studies. He at length proposed\nto me traveling all over Europe together, supporting ourselves\neverywhere by working at our business. I was once inclined to it; but,\nmentioning it to my good friend Mr. Denham, with whom I often spent an\nhour when I had leisure, he dissuaded me from it, advising me to think\nonly of returning to Pennsylvania, which he was now about to do.\n\nI must record one trait of this good man's character. He had formerly\nbeen in business at Bristol, but failed in debt to a number of people,\ncompounded and went to America. There, by a close application to\nbusiness as a merchant, he acquired a plentiful fortune in a few\nyears. Returning to England in the ship with me, he invited his old\ncreditors to an entertainment, at which he thank'd them for the easy\ncomposition they had favoured him with, and, when they expected\nnothing but the treat, every man at the first remove found under his\nplate an order on a banker for the full amount of the unpaid\nremainder with interest.\n\nHe now told me he was about to return to Philadelphia, and should\ncarry over a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there.\nHe propos'd to take me over as his clerk, to keep his books, in which\nhe would instruct me, copy his letters, and attend the store. He\nadded, that, as soon as I should be acquainted with mercantile\nbusiness, he would promote me by sending me with a cargo of flour and\nbread, etc., to the West Indies, and procure me commissions from\nothers which would be profitable; and, if I manag'd well, would\nestablish me handsomely. The thing pleas'd me; for I was grown tired\nof London, remembered with pleasure the happy months I had spent in\nPennsylvania, and wish'd again to see it; therefore I immediately\nagreed on the terms of fifty pounds a year,[49] Pennsylvania money;\nless, indeed, than my present gettings as a compositor, but affording\na better prospect.\n\n[49] About $167."

        "content": "I now took leave of printing, as I thought, forever, and was daily\nemployed in my new business, going about with Mr. Denham among the\ntradesmen to purchase various articles, and seeing them pack'd up,\ndoing errands, calling upon workmen to dispatch, etc.; and, when all\nwas on board, I had a few days' leisure. On one of these days, I was,\nto my surprise, sent for by a great man I knew only by name, a Sir\nWilliam Wyndham, and I waited upon him. He had heard by some means or\nother of my swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriars, and of my teaching\nWygate and another young man to swim in a few hours. He had two sons,\nabout to set out on their travels; he wish'd to have them first taught\nswimming, and proposed to gratify me handsomely if I would teach them.\nThey were not yet come to town, and my stay was uncertain, so I could\nnot undertake it; but, from this incident, I thought it likely that,\nif I were to remain in England and open a swimming-school, I might get\na good deal of money; and it struck me so strongly, that, had the\noverture been sooner made me, probably I should not so soon have\nreturned to America. After many years, you and I had something of more\nimportance to do with one of these sons of Sir William Wyndham,\nbecome Earl of Egremont, which I shall mention in its place.\n\nThus I spent about eighteen months in London; most part of the time I\nwork'd hard at my business, and spent but little upon myself except in\nseeing plays and in books. My friend Ralph had kept me poor; he owed\nme about twenty-seven pounds, which I was now never likely to receive;\na great sum out of my small earnings! I lov'd him, notwithstanding,\nfor he had many amiable qualities. I had by no means improv'd my\nfortune; but I had picked up some very ingenious acquaintance, whose\nconversation was of great advantage to me; and I had read\nconsiderably.\n\nVII\n\nBEGINNING BUSINESS IN\nPHILADELPHIA\n\nWe sail'd from Gravesend on the 23rd of July, 1726. For the incidents\nof the voyage, I refer you to my Journal, where you will find them all\nminutely related. Perhaps the most important part of that journal is\nthe _plan_[50] to be found in it, which I formed at sea, for\nregulating my future conduct in life. It is the more remarkable, as\nbeing formed when I was so young, and yet being pretty faithfully\nadhered to quite thro' to old age.\n\n[50] \"Not found in the manuscript journal, which was left\namong Franklin's papers.\"--Bigelow.\n\nWe landed in Philadelphia on the 11th of October, where I found sundry\nalterations. Keith was no longer governor, being superseded by Major\nGordon. I met him walking the streets as a common citizen. He seem'd a\nlittle asham'd at seeing me, but pass'd without saying anything. I\nshould have been as much asham'd at seeing Miss Read, had not her\nfriends, despairing with reason of my return after the receipt of my\nletter, persuaded her to marry another, one Rogers, a potter, which\nwas done in my absence. With him, however, she was never happy, and\nsoon parted from him, refusing to cohabit with him or bear his name,\nit being now said that he had another wife. He was a worthless fellow,\ntho' an excellent workman, which was the temptation to her friends. He\ngot into debt, ran away in 1727 or 1728, went to the West Indies, and\ndied there. Keimer had got a better house, a shop well supply'd with\nstationery, plenty of new types, a number of hands, tho' none good,\nand seem'd to have a great deal of business.\n\nMr. Denham took a store in Water-street, where we open'd our goods; I\nattended the business diligently, studied accounts, and grew, in a\nlittle time, expert at selling. We lodg'd and boarded together; he\ncounsell'd me as a father, having a sincere regard for me. I respected\nand loved him, and we might have gone on together very happy; but, in\nthe beginning of February, 1726/7, when I had just pass'd my\ntwenty-first year, we both were taken ill. My distemper was a\npleurisy, which very nearly carried me off. I suffered a good deal,\ngave up the point in my own mind, and was rather disappointed when I\nfound myself recovering, regretting, in some degree, that I must now,\nsome time or other, have all that disagreeable work to do over again.\nI forget what his distemper was; it held him a long time, and at\nlength carried him off. He left me a small legacy in a nuncupative\nwill, as a token of his kindness for me, and he left me once more to\nthe wide world; for the store was taken into the care of his\nexecutors, and my employment under him ended.\n\n[Illustration: \"Mr. Denham took a store in Water-street\"]\n\nMy brother-in-law, Holmes, being now at Philadelphia, advised my\nreturn to my business; and Keimer tempted me, with an offer of large\nwages by the year, to come and take the management of his\nprinting-house, that he might better attend his stationer's shop. I\nhad heard a bad character of him in London from his wife and her\nfriends, and was not fond of having any more to do with him. I tri'd\nfor farther employment as a merchant's clerk; but, not readily meeting\nwith any, I clos'd again with Keimer. I found in his house these\nhands: Hugh Meredith, a Welsh Pennsylvanian, thirty years of age, bred\nto country work; honest, sensible, had a great deal of solid\nobservation, was something of a reader, but given to drink. Stephen\nPotts, a young countryman of full age, bred to the same, of uncommon\nnatural parts, and great wit and humor, but a little idle. These he\nhad agreed with at extream low wages per week to be rais'd a shilling\nevery three months, as they would deserve by improving in their\nbusiness; and the expectation of these high wages, to come on\nhereafter, was what he had drawn them in with. Meredith was to work at\npress, Potts at book-binding, which he, by agreement, was to teach\nthem, though he knew neither one nor t'other. John----, a wild\nIrishman, brought up to no business, whose service, for four\nyears, Keimer had purchased from the captain of a ship; he, too, was\nto be made a pressman. George Webb, an Oxford scholar, whose time for\nfour years he had likewise bought, intending him for a compositor, of\nwhom more presently; and David Harry, a country boy, whom he had taken\napprentice.\n\nI soon perceiv'd that the intention of engaging me at wages so much\nhigher than he had been us'd to give, was, to have these raw, cheap\nhands form'd thro' me; and, as soon as I had instructed them, then\nthey being all articled to him, he should be able to do without me. I\nwent on, however, very chearfully, put his printing-house in order,\nwhich had been in great confusion, and brought his hands by degrees to\nmind their business and to do it better."

        "content": "It was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situation of a\nbought servant. He was not more than eighteen years of age, and gave\nme this account of himself; that he was born in Gloucester, educated\nat a grammar-school there, had been distinguish'd among the scholars\nfor some apparent superiority in performing his part, when they\nexhibited plays; belong'd to the Witty Club there, and had written\nsome pieces in prose and verse, which were printed in the Gloucester\nnewspapers; thence he was sent to Oxford; where he continued about a\nyear, but not well satisfi'd, wishing of all things to see London, and\nbecome a player. At length, receiving his quarterly allowance of\nfifteen guineas, instead of discharging his debts he walk'd out of\ntown, hid his gown in a furze bush, and footed it to London, where,\nhaving no friend to advise him, he fell into bad company, soon spent\nhis guineas, found no means of being introduc'd among the players,\ngrew necessitous, pawn'd his cloaths, and wanted bread. Walking the\nstreet very hungry, and not knowing what to do with himself, a crimp's\nbill[51] was put into his hand, offering immediate entertainment and\nencouragement to such as would bind themselves to serve in America. He\nwent directly, sign'd the indentures, was put into the ship, and came\nover, never writing a line to acquaint his friends what was become of\nhim. He was lively, witty, good-natur'd, and a pleasant companion, but\nidle, thoughtless, and imprudent to the last degree.\n\n[51] A crimp was the agent of a shipping company. Crimps\nwere sometimes employed to decoy men into such service\nas is here mentioned.\n\nJohn, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to live very\nagreeably, for they all respected me the more, as they found Keimer\nincapable of instructing them, and that from me they learned something\ndaily. We never worked on Saturday, that being Keimer's Sabbath, so I\nhad two days for reading. My acquaintance with ingenious people in the\ntown increased. Keimer himself treated me with great civility and\napparent regard, and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon,\nwhich I was yet unable to pay, being hitherto but a poor æconomist.\nHe, however, kindly made no demand of it.\n\nOur printing-house often wanted sorts, and there was no letter-founder\nin America; I had seen types cast at James's in London, but without\nmuch attention to the manner; however, I now contrived a mould, made\nuse of the letters we had as puncheons, struck the mattrices in lead,\nand thus supply'd in a pretty tolerable way all deficiencies. I also\nengrav'd several things on occasion; I made the ink; I was\nwarehouseman, and everything, and, in short, quite a fac-totum.\n\nBut, however serviceable I might be, I found that my services became\nevery day of less importance, as the other hands improv'd in the\nbusiness; and, when Keimer paid my second quarter's wages, he let me\nknow that he felt them too heavy, and thought I should make an\nabatement. He grew by degrees less civil, put on more of the master,\nfrequently found fault, was captious, and seem'd ready for an\noutbreaking. I went on, nevertheless, with a good deal of patience,\nthinking that his encumber'd circumstances were partly the cause. At\nlength a trifle snapt our connections; for, a great noise happening\nnear the court-house, I put my head out of the window to see what was\nthe matter. Keimer, being in the street, look'd up and saw me, call'd\nout to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business, adding\nsome reproachful words, that nettled me the more for their publicity,\nall the neighbours who were looking out on the same occasion being\nwitnesses how I was treated. He came up immediately into the\nprinting-house, continu'd the quarrel, high words pass'd on both\nsides, he gave me the quarter's warning we had stipulated, expressing\na wish that he had not been oblig'd to so long a warning. I told him\nhis wish was unnecessary, for I would leave him that instant; and so,\ntaking my hat, walk'd out of doors, desiring Meredith, whom I saw\nbelow, to take care of some things I left, and bring them to my\nlodgings.\n\nMeredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my affair\nover. He had conceiv'd a great regard for me, and was very unwilling\nthat I should leave the house while he remain'd in it. He dissuaded me\nfrom returning to my native country, which I began to think of; he\nreminded me that Keimer was in debt for all he possess'd; that his\ncreditors began to be uneasy; that he kept his shop miserably, sold\noften without profit for ready money, and often trusted without\nkeeping accounts; that he must therefore fail, which would make a\nvacancy I might profit of. I objected my want of money. He then let me\nknow that his father had a high opinion of me, and, from some\ndiscourse that had pass'd between them, he was sure would advance\nmoney to set us up, if I would enter into partnership with him. \"My\ntime,\" says he, \"will be out with Keimer in the spring; by that time\nwe may have our press and types in from London. I am sensible I am no\nworkman; if you like it, your skill in the business shall be set\nagainst the stock I furnish, and we will share the profits equally.\"\n\nThe proposal was agreeable, and I consented; his father was in town\nand approv'd of it; the more as he saw I had great influence with his\nson, had prevailed on him to abstain long from dram-drinking, and he\nhop'd might break him of that wretched habit entirely, when we came to\nbe so closely connected. I gave an inventory to the father, who\ncarry'd it to a merchant; the things were sent for, the secret was to\nbe kept till they should arrive, and in the meantime I was to get\nwork, if I could, at the other printing-house. But I found no vacancy\nthere, and so remained idle a few days, when Keimer, on a prospect of\nbeing employ'd to print some paper money in New Jersey, which would\nrequire cuts and various types that I only could supply, and\napprehending Bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him, sent\nme a very civil message, that old friends should not part for a few\nwords, the effect of sudden passion, and wishing me to return.\nMeredith persuaded me to comply, as it would give more opportunity for\nhis improvement under my daily instructions; so I return'd, and we\nwent on more smoothly than for some time before. The New Jersey jobb\nwas obtained, I contriv'd a copperplate press for it, the first that\nhad been seen in the country; I cut several ornaments and checks for\nthe bills. We went together to Burlington, where I executed the whole\nto satisfaction; and he received so large a sum for the work as to be\nenabled thereby to keep his head much longer above water.\n\nAt Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal people of the\nprovince. Several of them had been appointed by the Assembly a\ncommittee to attend the press, and take care that no more bills were\nprinted than the law directed. They were therefore, by turns,\nconstantly with us, and generally he who attended, brought with him a\nfriend or two for company. My mind having been much more improv'd by\nreading than Keimer's, I suppose it was for that reason my\nconversation seem'd to be more valu'd. They had me to their houses,\nintroduced me to their friends, and show'd me much civility; while he,\ntho' the master, was a little neglected. In truth, he was an odd fish;\nignorant of common life, fond of rudely opposing receiv'd opinions,\nslovenly to extream dirtiness, enthusiastic in some points of\nreligion, and a little knavish withal."

And I now repeat, that there is less\nprobability that those men have been bribed and corrupted, than that\nany seven men, or rather any six men, that could be selected from the\nmembers of this House, might be so bribed and corrupted, even though\nthey were headed and led on by \"decided superiority\" himself.\n\nIn all seriousness, I ask every reasonable man, if an issue be joined\nby these twenty-four commissioners, on the one part, and any other\nseven men, on the other part, and the whole depend upon the honor and\nintegrity of the contending parties, to which party would the greatest\ndegree of credit be due? Again: Another consideration is, that we have\nno right to make the examination. What I shall say upon this head I\ndesign exclusively for the law-loving and law-abiding part of the House.\nTo those who claim omnipotence for the Legislature, and who in the\nplenitude of their assumed powers are disposed to disregard the\nConstitution, law, good faith, moral right, and everything else, I have\nnot a word to say. But to the law-abiding part I say, examine the Bank\ncharter, go examine the Constitution, go examine the acts that the\nGeneral Assembly of this State has passed, and you will find just as\nmuch authority given in each and every of them to compel the Bank to\nbring its coffers to this hall and to pour their contents upon this\nfloor, as to compel it to submit to this examination which this\nresolution proposes. Why, Sir, the gentleman from Coles, the mover of\nthis resolution, very lately denied on this floor that the Legislature\nhad any right to repeal or otherwise meddle with its own acts, when\nthose acts were made in the nature of contracts, and had been accepted\nand acted on by other parties. Now I ask if this resolution does not\npropose, for this House alone, to do what he, but the other day, denied\nthe right of the whole Legislature to do? He must either abandon the\nposition he then took, or he must now vote against his own resolution.\nIt is no difference to me, and I presume but little to any one else,\nwhich he does.\n\nI am by no means the special advocate of the Bank. I have long thought\nthat it would be well for it to report its condition to the General\nAssembly, and that cases might occur, when it might be proper to make an\nexamination of its affairs by a committee. Accordingly, during the\nlast session, while a bill supplemental to the Bank charter was pending\nbefore the House, I offered an amendment to the same, in these words:\n\"The said corporation shall, at the next session of the General\nAssembly, and at each subsequent General Session, during the existence\nof its charter, report to the same the amount of debts due from said\ncorporation; the amount of debts due to the same; the amount of specie\nin its vaults, and an account of all lands then owned by the same, and\nthe amount for which such lands have been taken; and moreover, if said\ncorporation shall at any time neglect or refuse to submit its books,\npapers, and all and everything necessary for a full and fair examination\nof its affairs, to any person or persons appointed by the General\nAssembly, for the purpose of making such examination, the said\ncorporation shall forfeit its charter.\"\n\nThis amendment was negatived by a vote of 34 to 15. Eleven of the 34 who\nvoted against it are now members of this House; and though it would\nbe out of order to call their names, I hope they will all recollect\nthemselves, and not vote for this examination to be made without\nauthority, inasmuch as they refused to receive the authority when it was\nin their power to do so.\n\nI have said that cases might occur, when an examination might be proper;\nbut I do not believe any such case has now occurred; and if it has,\nI should still be opposed to making an examination without legal\nauthority. I am opposed to encouraging that lawless and mobocratic\nspirit, whether in relation to the Bank or anything else, which is\nalready abroad in the land and is spreading with rapid and fearful\nimpetuosity, to the ultimate overthrow of every institution, of every\nmoral principle, in which persons and property have hitherto found\nsecurity.\n\nBut supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result\nfrom the examination? Can we declare the Bank unconstitutional, and\ncompel it to desist from the abuses of its power, provided we find such\nabuses to exist? Can we repair the injuries which it may have done to\nindividuals? Most certainly we can do none of these things. Why\nthen shall we spend the public money in such employment? Oh, say the\nexaminers, we can injure the credit of the Bank, if nothing else, Please\ntell me, gentlemen, who will suffer most by that? You cannot injure, to\nany extent, the stockholders. They are men of wealth--of large capital;\nand consequently, beyond the power of malice. But by injuring the credit\nof the Bank, you will depreciate the value of its paper in the hands of\nthe honest and unsuspecting farmer and mechanic, and that is all you can\ndo. But suppose you could effect your whole purpose; suppose you could\nwipe the Bank from existence, which is the grand ultimatum of the\nproject, what would be the consequence? why, Sir, we should spend\nseveral thousand dollars of the public treasure in the operation,\nannihilate the currency of the State, render valueless in the hands of\nour people that reward of their former labors, and finally be once more\nunder the comfortable obligation of paying the Wiggins loan, principal\nand interest.\n\nOPPOSITION TO MOB-RULE\n\nADDRESS BEFORE THE YOUNG MEN'S LYCEUM OF SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS.\n\nJanuary 27, 1837.\n\nAs a subject for the remarks of the evening, \"The Perpetuation of our\nPolitical Institutions\" is selected.\n\nIn the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the American\npeople, find our account running under date of the nineteenth century of\nthe Christian era. We find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the\nfairest portion of the earth as regards extent of territory, fertility\nof soil, and salubrity of climate. We find ourselves under the\ngovernment of a system of political institutions conducing more\nessentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which\nthe history of former times tells us. We, when mounting the stage of\nexistence, found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental\nblessings. We toiled not in the acquirement or establishment of them;\nthey are a legacy bequeathed us by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic,\nbut now lamented and departed, race of ancestors. Theirs was the\ntask (and nobly they performed it) to possess themselves, and through\nthemselves us, of this goodly land, and to uprear upon its hills and its\nvalleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; it is ours only\nto transmit these--the former unprofaned by the foot of an invader, the\nlatter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpation--to the\nlatest generation that fate shall permit the world to know. This task\ngratitude to our fathers, justice to ourselves, duty to posterity, and\nlove for our species in general, all imperatively require us faithfully\nto perform.\n\nHow then shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the approach\nof danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we expect\nsome transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a\nblow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with\nall the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military\nchest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink\nfrom the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand\nyears."

        "content": "At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer:\nIf it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from\nabroad. If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and\nfinisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time, or die\nby suicide.\n\nI hope I am over-wary; but if I am not, there is even now something\nof ill omen amongst us. I mean the increasing disregard for law which\npervades the country--the growing disposition to substitute the wild and\nfurious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts, and the\nworse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice. This\ndisposition is awfully fearful in any community; and that it now\nexists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit, it would be a\nviolation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny. Accounts\nof outrages committed by mobs form the everyday news of the times.\nThey have pervaded the country from New England to Louisiana; they are\nneither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former nor the burning suns\nof the latter; they are not the creature of climate, neither are they\nconfined to the slave holding or the non-slave holding States. Alike\nthey spring up among the pleasure-hunting masters of Southern slaves,\nand the order-loving citizens of the land of steady habits. Whatever\nthen their cause may be, it is common to the whole country.\n\nIt would be tedious as well as useless to recount the horrors of all of\nthem. Those happening in the State of Mississippi and at St. Louis are\nperhaps the most dangerous in example and revolting to humanity. In the\nMississippi case they first commenced by hanging the regular gamblers--a\nset of men certainly not following for a livelihood a very useful or\nvery honest occupation, but one which, so far from being forbidden by\nthe laws, was actually licensed by an act of the Legislature passed but\na single year before. Next, negroes suspected of conspiring to raise an\ninsurrection were caught up and hanged in all parts of the State;\nthen, white men supposed to be leagued with the negroes; and finally,\nstrangers from neighboring States, going thither on business, were in\nmany instances subjected to the same fate. Thus went on this process of\nhanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes to white citizens, and\nfrom these to strangers, till dead men were seen literally dangling\nfrom the boughs of trees upon every roadside, and in numbers almost\nsufficient to rival the native Spanish moss of the country as a drapery\nof the forest.\n\nTurn then to that horror-striking scene at St. Louis. A single victim\nonly was sacrificed there. This story is very short, and is perhaps\nthe most highly tragic of anything of its length that has ever been\nwitnessed in real life. A mulatto man by the name of McIntosh was seized\nin the street, dragged to the suburbs of the city, chained to a tree,\nand actually burned to death; and all within a single hour from the time\nhe had been a freeman attending to his own business and at peace with\nthe world.\n\nSuch are the effects of mob law, and such are the scenes becoming more\nand more frequent in this land so lately famed for love of law and\norder, and the stories of which have even now grown too familiar to\nattract anything more than an idle remark.\n\nBut you are perhaps ready to ask, \"What has this to do with the\nperpetuation of our political institutions?\" I answer, It has much to\ndo with it. Its direct consequences are, comparatively speaking, but\na small evil, and much of its danger consists in the proneness of\nour minds to regard its direct as its only consequences. Abstractly\nconsidered, the hanging of the gamblers at Vicksburg was of but little\nconsequence. They constitute a portion of population that is worse than\nuseless in any community; and their death, if no pernicious example be\nset by it, is never matter of reasonable regret with any one. If\nthey were annually swept from the stage of existence by the plague or\nsmallpox, honest men would perhaps be much profited by the operation.\nSimilar too is the correct reasoning in regard to the burning of the\nnegro at St. Louis. He had forfeited his life by the perpetration of an\noutrageous murder upon one of the most worthy and respectable citizens\nof the city, and had he not died as he did, he must have died by the\nsentence of the law in a very short time afterwards. As to him alone,\nit was as well the way it was as it could otherwise have been. But the\nexample in either case was fearful. When men take it in their heads\nto-day to hang gamblers or burn murderers, they should recollect that in\nthe confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely\nto hang or burn some one who is neither a gambler nor a murderer as one\nwho is, and that, acting upon the example they set, the mob of to-morrow\nmay, and probably will, hang or burn some of them by the very same\nmistake. And not only so: the innocent, those who have ever set their\nfaces against violations of law in every shape, alike with the guilty\nfall victims to the ravages of mob law; and thus it goes on, step by\nstep, till all the walls erected for the defense of the persons and\nproperty of individuals are trodden down and disregarded. But all this,\neven, is not the full extent of the evil. By such examples, by instances\nof the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, the lawless in spirit\nare encouraged to become lawless in practice; and having been used to\nno restraint but dread of punishment, they thus become absolutely\nunrestrained. Having ever regarded government as their deadliest bane,\nthey make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations, and pray for\nnothing so much as its total annihilation. While, on the other hand,\ngood men, men who love tranquillity, who desire to abide by the laws and\nenjoy their benefits, who would gladly spill their blood in the defense\nof their country, seeing their property destroyed, their families\ninsulted, and their lives endangered, their persons injured, and seeing\nnothing in prospect that forebodes a change for the better, become tired\nof and disgusted with a government that offers them no protection, and\nare not much averse to a change in which they imagine they have nothing\nto lose. Thus, then, by the operation of this mobocratic spirit which\nall must admit is now abroad in the land, the strongest bulwark of\nany government, and particularly of those constituted like ours, may\neffectually be broken down and destroyed--I mean the attachment of the\npeople. Whenever this effect shall be produced among us; whenever the\nvicious portion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands\nof hundreds and thousands, and burn churches, ravage and rob\nprovision-stores, throw printing presses into rivers, shoot editors, and\nhang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity, depend on\nit, this government cannot last. By such things the feelings of the best\ncitizens will become more or less alienated from it, and thus it will\nbe left without friends, or with too few, and those few too weak to\nmake their friendship effectual. At such a time, and under such\ncircumstances, men of sufficient talent and ambition will not be wanting\nto seize the opportunity, strike the blow, and overturn that fair fabric\nwhich for the last half century has been the fondest hope of the lovers\nof freedom throughout the world.\n\nI know the American people are much attached to their government; I know\nthey would suffer much for its sake; I know they would endure evils\nlong and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it for\nanother,--yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws be continually\ndespised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons\nand property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob,\nthe alienation of their affections from the government is the natural\nconsequence; and to that, sooner or later, it must come.\n\nHere, then, is one point at which danger may be expected."

        "content": "The question recurs, How shall we fortify against it? The answer is\nsimple. Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to\nhis posterity swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate\nin the least particular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate\ntheir violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did to the\nsupport of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the\nConstitution and laws let every American pledge his life, his property,\nand his sacred honor. Let every man remember that to violate the law is\nto trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the charter of his\nown and his children's liberty. Let reverence for the laws be breathed\nby every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap;\nlet it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges; let it be\nwritten in primers, spelling books, and in almanacs; let it be preached\nfrom the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts\nof justice. And, in short, let it become the political religion of the\nnation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the\ngrave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions,\nsacrifice unceasingly upon its altars.\n\nWhile ever a state of feeling such as this shall universally or even\nvery generally prevail throughout the nation, vain will be every effort,\nand fruitless every attempt, to subvert our national freedom.\n\nWhen, I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me\nnot be understood as saying there are no bad laws, or that grievances\nmay not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been\nmade. I mean to say no such thing. But I do mean to say that although\nbad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still,\nwhile they continue in force, for the sake of example they should be\nreligiously observed. So also in unprovided cases. If such arise, let\nproper legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay,\nbut till then let them, if not too intolerable, be borne with.\n\nThere is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law. In any\ncase that may arise, as, for instance, the promulgation of abolitionism,\none of two positions is necessarily true--that is, the thing is right\nwithin itself, and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all\ngood citizens, or it is wrong, and therefore proper to be prohibited by\nlegal enactments; and in neither case is the interposition of mob law\neither necessary, justifiable, or excusable.\n\nBut it may be asked, Why suppose danger to our political institutions?\nHave we not preserved them for more than fifty years? And why may we not\nfor fifty times as long?\n\nWe hope there is no sufficient reason. We hope all danger may be\novercome; but to conclude that no danger may ever arise would itself be\nextremely dangerous. There are now, and will hereafter be, many causes,\ndangerous in their tendency, which have not existed heretofore, and\nwhich are not too insignificant to merit attention. That our government\nshould have been maintained in its original form, from its establishment\nuntil now, is not much to be wondered at. It had many props to support\nit through that period, which now are decayed and crumbled away. Through\nthat period it was felt by all to be an undecided experiment; now it is\nunderstood to be a successful one. Then, all that sought celebrity\nand fame and distinction expected to find them in the success of that\nexperiment. Their all was staked upon it; their destiny was inseparably\nlinked with it. Their ambition aspired to display before an admiring\nworld a practical demonstration of the truth of a proposition which had\nhitherto been considered at best no better than problematical--namely,\nthe capability of a people to govern themselves. If they succeeded they\nwere to be immortalized; their names were to be transferred to counties,\nand cities, and rivers, and mountains; and to be revered and sung,\ntoasted through all time. If they failed, they were to be called\nknaves and fools, and fanatics for a fleeting hour; then to sink and be\nforgotten. They succeeded. The experiment is successful, and thousands\nhave won their deathless names in making it so. But the game is caught;\nand I believe it is true that with the catching end the pleasures of\nthe chase. This field of glory is harvested, and the crop is already\nappropriated. But new reapers will arise, and they too will seek a\nfield. It is to deny what the history of the world tells us is true, to\nsuppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring\nup amongst us. And when they do, they will as naturally seek the\ngratification of their ruling passion as others have done before them.\nThe question then is, Can that gratification be found in supporting\nand in maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others? Most\ncertainly it cannot. Many great and good men, sufficiently qualified for\nany task they should undertake, may ever be found whose ambition would\naspire to nothing beyond a seat in Congress, a Gubernatorial or a\nPresidential chair; but such belong not to the family of the lion, or\nthe tribe of the eagle. What! think you these places would satisfy an\nAlexander, a Caesar, or a Napoleon? Never! Towering genius disdains\na beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored. It sees no\ndistinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected\nto the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve\nunder any chief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor,\nhowever illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and if\npossible, it will have it, whether at the expense of emancipating slaves\nor enslaving freemen. Is it unreasonable, then, to expect that some man\npossessed of the loftiest genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to\npush it to its utmost stretch, will at some time spring up among us? And\nwhen such an one does it will require the people to be united with each\nother, attached to the government and laws, and generally intelligent,\nto successfully frustrate his designs.\n\nDistinction will be his paramount object, and although he would as\nwillingly, perhaps more so, acquire it by doing good as harm, yet,\nthat opportunity being past, and nothing left to be done in the way of\nbuilding up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling down.\n\nHere then is a probable case, highly dangerous, and such an one as could\nnot have well existed heretofore.\n\nAnother reason which once was, but which, to the same extent, is now no\nmore, has done much in maintaining our institutions thus far. I mean the\npowerful influence which the interesting scenes of the Revolution had\nupon the passions of the people as distinguished from their judgment. By\nthis influence, the jealousy, envy, and avarice incident to our nature,\nand so common to a state of peace, prosperity, and conscious strength,\nwere for the time in a great measure smothered and rendered inactive,\nwhile the deep-rooted principles of hate, and the powerful motive of\nrevenge, instead of being turned against each other, were directed\nexclusively against the British nation. And thus, from the force of\ncircumstances, the basest principles of our nature were either made to\nlie dormant, or to become the active agents in the advancement of\nthe noblest of causes--that of establishing and maintaining civil and\nreligious liberty.\n\nBut this state of feeling must fade, is fading, has faded, with the\ncircumstances that produced it."

Even then they\ncannot be so universally known nor so vividly felt as they were by the\ngeneration just gone to rest. At the close of that struggle, nearly\nevery adult male had been a participator in some of its scenes. The\nconsequence was that of those scenes, in the form of a husband, a\nfather, a son, or a brother, a living history was to be found in\nevery family--a history bearing the indubitable testimonies of its own\nauthenticity, in the limbs mangled, in the scars of wounds received, in\nthe midst of the very scenes related--a history, too, that could be read\nand understood alike by all, the wise and the ignorant, the learned and\nthe unlearned.

I shall send this, turn out as it may.\n\nThis thing of living in Springfield is rather a dull business, after\nall; at least it is so to me. I am quite as lonesome here as I ever was\nanywhere in my life. I have been spoken to by but one woman since I have\nbeen here, and should not have been by her if she could have avoided it.\nI 've never been to church yet, and probably shall not be soon. I stay\naway because I am conscious I should not know how to behave myself.\n\nI am often thinking of what we said about your coming to live at\nSpringfield. I am afraid you would not be satisfied. There is a great\ndeal of flourishing about in carriages here, which it would be your doom\nto see without sharing it. You would have to be poor, without the means\nof hiding your poverty. Do you believe you could bear that patiently?\nWhatever woman may cast her lot with mine, should any ever do so, it is\nmy intention to do all in my power to make her happy and contented; and\nthere is nothing I can imagine that would make me more unhappy than to\nfail in the effort. I know I should be much happier with you than the\nway I am, provided I saw no signs of discontent in you. What you have\nsaid to me may have been in the way of jest, or I may have misunderstood\nyou. If so, then let it be forgotten; if otherwise, I much wish you\nwould think seriously before you decide. What I have said I will most\npositively abide by, provided you wish it. My opinion is that you had\nbetter not do it.

Do not understand by this that I wish to cut your\nacquaintance. I mean no such thing. What I do wish is that our further\nacquaintance shall depend upon yourself. If such further acquaintance\nwould contribute nothing to your happiness, I am sure it would not to\nmine. If you feel yourself in any degree bound to me, I am now willing\nto release you, provided you wish it; while on the other hand I am\nwilling and even anxious to bind you faster if I can be convinced\nthat it will, in any considerable degree, add to your happiness. This,\nindeed, is the whole question with me. Nothing would make me more\nmiserable than to believe you miserable, nothing more happy than to know\nyou were so.\n\nIn what I have now said, I think I cannot be misunderstood; and to make\nmyself understood is the only object of this letter.\n\nIf it suits you best not to answer this, farewell. A long life and\na merry one attend you. But, if you conclude to write back, speak as\nplainly as I do. There can neither be harm nor danger in saying to me\nanything you think, just in the manner you think it. My respects to your\nsister.\n\nYour friend, LINCOLN.\n\nLEGAL SUIT OF WIDOW v.s. Gen. ADAMS\n\nTO THE PEOPLE.\n\n\"SANGAMON JOURNAL,\" SPRINGFIELD, ILL., Aug. 19, 1837.\n\nIn accordance with our determination, as expressed last week, we present\nto the reader the articles which were published in hand-bill form, in\nreference to the case of the heirs of Joseph Anderson vs. James Adams.\nThese articles can now be read uninfluenced by personal or party\nfeeling, and with the sole motive of learning the truth. When that is\ndone, the reader can pass his own judgment on the matters at issue.\n\nWe only regret in this case, that the publications were not made some\nweeks before the election. Such a course might have prevented the\nexpressions of regret, which have often been heard since, from different\nindividuals, on account of the disposition they made of their votes.\n\nTo the Public:\n\nIt is well known to most of you, that there is existing at this time\nconsiderable excitement in regard to Gen. Adams's titles to certain\ntracts of land, and the manner in which he acquired them. As I\nunderstand, the Gen. charges that the whole has been gotten up by a knot\nof lawyers to injure his election; and as I am one of the knot to which\nhe refers, and as I happen to be in possession of facts connected with\nthe matter, I will, in as brief a manner as possible, make a statement\nof them, together with the means by which I arrived at the knowledge of\nthem.\n\nSometime in May or June last, a widow woman, by the name of Anderson,\nand her son, who resides in Fulton county, came to Springfield, for\nthe purpose as they said of selling a ten acre lot of ground lying near\ntown, which they claimed as the property of the deceased husband and\nfather.\n\nWhen they reached town they found the land was claimed by Gen. Adams.\nJohn T. Stuart and myself were employed to look into the matter, and if\nit was thought we could do so with any prospect of success, to commence\na suit for the land. I went immediately to the recorder's office to\nexamine Adams's title, and found that the land had been entered by one\nDixon, deeded by Dixon to Thomas, by Thomas to one Miller, and by Miller\nto Gen. Adams. The oldest of these three deeds was about ten or eleven\nyears old, and the latest more than five, all recorded at the same\ntime, and that within less than one year. This I thought a suspicious\ncircumstance, and I was thereby induced to examine the deeds very\nclosely, with a view to the discovery of some defect by which to\noverturn the title, being almost convinced then it was founded in fraud.\nI discovered that in the deed from Thomas to Miller, although Miller's\nname stood in a sort of marginal note on the record book, it was nowhere\nin the deed itself. I told the fact to Talbott, the recorder, and\nproposed to him that he should go to Gen. Adams's and get the original\ndeed, and compare it with the record, and thereby ascertain whether\nthe defect was in the original or there was merely an error in the\nrecording. As Talbott afterwards told me, he went to the General's, but\nnot finding him at home, got the deed from his son, which, when compared\nwith the record, proved what we had discovered was merely an error of\nthe recorder. After Mr. Talbott corrected the record, he brought the\noriginal to our office, as I then thought and think yet, to show us\nthat it was right. When he came into the room he handed the deed to me,\nremarking that the fault was all his own. On opening it, another paper\nfell out of it, which on examination proved to be an assignment of a\njudgment in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County from Joseph Anderson,\nthe late husband of the widow above named, to James Adams, the judgment\nbeing in favor of said Anderson against one Joseph Miller. Knowing that\nthis judgment had some connection with the land affair, I immediately\ntook a copy of it, which is word for word, letter for letter and cross\nfor cross as follows:\n\nJoseph Anderson, vs. Joseph Miller.\n\nJudgment in Sangamon Circuit Court against Joseph Miller obtained on a\nnote originally 25 dolls and interest thereon accrued. I assign all my\nright, title and interest to James Adams which is in consideration of a\ndebt I owe said Adams.\n\nhis JOSEPH x ANDERSON. mark."

        "content": "As the copy shows, it bore date May 10, 1827; although the judgment\nassigned by it was not obtained until the October afterwards, as may be\nseen by any one on the records of the Circuit Court. Two other strange\ncircumstances attended it which cannot be represented by a copy. One of\nthem was, that the date \"1827\" had first been made \"1837\" and, without\nthe figure \"3,\" being fully obliterated, the figure \"2\" had afterwards\nbeen made on top of it; the other was that, although the date was ten\nyears old, the writing on it, from the freshness of its appearance, was\nthought by many, and I believe by all who saw it, not to be more than a\nweek old. The paper on which it was written had a very old appearance;\nand there were some old figures on the back of it which made the\nfreshness of the writing on the face of it much more striking than I\nsuppose it otherwise might have been. The reader's curiosity is no doubt\nexcited to know what connection this assignment had with the land in\nquestion. The story is this: Dixon sold and deeded the land to Thomas;\nThomas sold it to Anderson; but before he gave a deed, Anderson sold it\nto Miller, and took Miller's note for the purchase money. When this\nnote became due, Anderson sued Miller on it, and Miller procured an\ninjunction from the Court of Chancery to stay the collection of the\nmoney until he should get a deed for the land. Gen. Adams was employed\nas an attorney by Anderson in this chancery suit, and at the October\nterm, 1827, the injunction was dissolved, and a judgment given in favor\nof Anderson against Miller; and it was provided that Thomas was to\nexecute a deed for the land in favor of Miller and deliver it to Gen.\nAdams, to be held up by him till Miller paid the judgment, and then to\ndeliver it to him. Miller left the county without paying the judgment.\nAnderson moved to Fulton county, where he has since died When the widow\ncame to Springfield last May or June, as before mentioned, and found the\nland deeded to Gen. Adams by Miller, she was naturally led to inquire\nwhy the money due upon the judgment had not been sent to them, inasmuch\nas he, Gen. Adams, had no authority to deliver Thomas's deed to Miller\nuntil the money was paid. Then it was the General told her, or perhaps\nher son, who came with her, that Anderson, in his lifetime, had assigned\nthe judgment to him, Gen. Adams. I am now told that the General is\nexhibiting an assignment of the same judgment bearing date \"1828\" and\nin other respects differing from the one described; and that he is\nasserting that no such assignment as the one copied by me ever existed;\nor if there did, it was forged between Talbott and the lawyers, and\nslipped into his papers for the purpose of injuring him. Now, I can only\nsay that I know precisely such a one did exist, and that Ben. Talbott,\nWm. Butler, C.R. Matheny, John T. Stuart, Judge Logan, Robert Irwin, P."

ADAMS.\n\n\"SANGAMON JOURNAL,\" SPRINGFIELD, ILL., Oct. 28, 1837.\n\nIn the Republican of this morning a publication of Gen. Adams's appears,\nin which my name is used quite unreservedly. For this I thank the\nGeneral. I thank him because it gives me an opportunity, without\nappearing obtrusive, of explaining a part of a former publication of\nmine, which appears to me to have been misunderstood by many.\n\nIn the former publication alluded to, I stated, in substance, that\nMr. Talbott got a deed from a son of Gen. Adams's for the purpose of\ncorrecting a mistake that had occurred on the record of the said deed\nin the recorder's office; that he corrected the record, and brought the\ndeed and handed it to me, and that on opening the deed, another paper,\nbeing the assignment of a judgment, fell out of it. This statement\nGen. Adams and the editor of the Republican have seized upon as a most\npalpable evidence of fabrication and falsehood. They set themselves\ngravely about proving that the assignment could not have been in the\ndeed when Talbott got it from young Adams, as he, Talbott, would have\nseen it when he opened the deed to correct the record. Now, the truth\nis, Talbott did see the assignment when he opened the deed, or at least\nhe told me he did on the same day; and I only omitted to say so, in\nmy former publication, because it was a matter of such palpable and\nnecessary inference. I had stated that Talbott had corrected the record\nby the deed; and of course he must have opened it; and, just as the\nGeneral and his friends argue, must have seen the assignment. I omitted\nto state the fact of Talbott's seeing the assignment, because its\nexistence was so necessarily connected with other facts which I did\nstate, that I thought the greatest dunce could not but understand\nit. Did I say Talbott had not seen it? Did I say anything that was\ninconsistent with his having seen it before? Most certainly I did\nneither; and if I did not, what becomes of the argument? These logical\ngentlemen can sustain their argument only by assuming that I did say\nnegatively everything that I did not say affirmatively; and upon the\nsame assumption, we may expect to find the General, if a little harder\npressed for argument, saying that I said Talbott came to our office with\nhis head downward, not that I actually said so, but because I omitted to\nsay he came feet downward.\n\nIn his publication to-day, the General produces the affidavit of Reuben\nRadford, in which it is said that Talbott told Radford that he did not\nfind the assignment in the deed, in the recording of which the error\nwas committed, but that he found it wrapped in another paper in the\nrecorder's office, upon which statement the Genl. comments as follows,\nto wit: \"If it be true as stated by Talbott to Radford, that he\nfound the assignment wrapped up in another paper at his office, that\ncontradicts the statement of Lincoln that it fell out of the deed.\"\n\nIs common sense to be abused with such sophistry? Did I say what Talbott\nfound it in? If Talbott did find it in another paper at his office, is\nthat any reason why he could not have folded it in a deed and brought\nit to my office? Can any one be so far duped as to be made believe that\nwhat may have happened at Talbot's office at one time is inconsistent\nwith what happened at my office at another time?\n\nNow Talbott's statement of the case as he makes it to me is this, that\nhe got a bunch of deeds from young Adams, and that he knows he found the\nassignment in the bunch, but he is not certain which particular deed it\nwas in, nor is he certain whether it was folded in the same deed out of\nwhich it was taken, or another one, when it was brought to my office. Is\nthis a mysterious story? Is there anything suspicious about it?\n\n\"But it is useless to dwell longer on this point. Any man who is not\nwilfully blind can see at a flash, that there is no discrepancy, and\nLincoln has shown that they are not only inconsistent with truth, but\neach other\"--I can only say, that I have shown that he has done no such\nthing; and if the reader is disposed to require any other evidence than\nthe General's assertion, he will be of my opinion.\n\nExcepting the General's most flimsy attempt at mystification, in regard\nto a discrepance between Talbott and myself, he has not denied a single\nstatement that I made in my hand-bill. Every material statement that\nI made has been sworn to by men who, in former times, were thought as\nrespectable as General Adams. I stated that an assignment of a judgment,\na copy of which I gave, had existed--Benj. Talbott, C. R. Matheny, Wm.\nButler, and Judge Logan swore to its existence. I stated that it was\nsaid to be in Gen. Adams's handwriting--the same men swore it was in\nhis handwriting. I stated that Talbott would swear that he got it out of\nGen. Adams's possession--Talbott came forward and did swear it.\n\nBidding adieu to the former publication, I now propose to examine the\nGeneral's last gigantic production. I now propose to point out some\ndiscrepancies in the General's address; and such, too, as he shall not\nbe able to escape from. Speaking of the famous assignment, the General\nsays: \"This last charge, which was their last resort, their dying\neffort to render my character infamous among my fellow citizens, was\nmanufactured at a certain lawyer's office in the town, printed at the\noffice of the Sangamon Journal, and found its way into the world some\ntime between two days just before the last election.\" Now turn to Mr.\nKeys' affidavit, in which you will find the following, viz.: \"I\ncertify that some time in May or the early part of June, 1837, I saw\nat Williams's corner a paper purporting to be an assignment from Joseph\nAnderson to James Adams, which assignment was signed by a mark to\nAnderson's name,\" etc. Now mark, if Keys saw the assignment on the last\nof May or first of June, Gen. Adams tells a falsehood when he says\nit was manufactured just before the election, which was on the 7th of\nAugust; and if it was manufactured just before the election, Keys tells\na falsehood when he says he saw it on the last of May or first of\nJune. Either Keys or the General is irretrievably in for it; and in the\nGeneral's very condescending language, I say \"Let them settle it between\nthem.\""

        "content": "Now again, let the reader, bearing in mind that General Adams has\nunequivocally said, in one part of his address, that the charge in\nrelation to the assignment was manufactured just before the election,\nturn to the affidavit of Peter S. Weber, where the following will be\nfound viz.: \"I, Peter S. Weber, do certify that from the best of\nmy recollection, on the day or day after Gen. Adams started for the\nIllinois Rapids, in May last, that I was at the house of Gen. Adams,\nsitting in the kitchen, situated on the back part of the house, it being\nin the afternoon, and that Benjamin Talbott came around the house, back\ninto the kitchen, and appeared wild and confused, and that he laid a\npackage of papers on the kitchen table and requested that they should be\nhanded to Lucian. He made no apology for coming to the kitchen, nor\nfor not handing them to Lucian himself, but showed the token of being\nfrightened and confused both in demeanor and speech and for what cause I\ncould not apprehend.\"\n\nCommenting on Weber's affidavit, Gen. Adams asks, \"Why this fright and\nconfusion?\" I reply that this is a question for the General himself.\nWeber says that it was in May, and if so, it is most clear that Talbott\nwas not frightened on account of the assignment, unless the General\nlies when he says the assignment charge was manufactured just before the\nelection. Is it not a strong evidence, that the General is not traveling\nwith the pole-star of truth in his front, to see him in one part of\nhis address roundly asserting that the assignment was manufactured\njust before the election, and then, forgetting that position, procuring\nWeber's most foolish affidavit, to prove that Talbott had been engaged\nin manufacturing it two months before?\n\nIn another part of his address, Gen. Adams says: \"That I hold an\nassignment of said judgment, dated the 20th of May, 1828, and signed\nby said Anderson, I have never pretended to deny or conceal, but stated\nthat fact in one of my circulars previous to the election, and also\nin answer to a bill in chancery.\" Now I pronounce this statement\nunqualifiedly false, and shall not rely on the word or oath of any\nman to sustain me in what I say; but will let the whole be decided by\nreference to the circular and answer in chancery of which the General\nspeaks. In his circular he did speak of an assignment; but he did not\nsay it bore date 20th of May, 1828; nor did he say it bore any date. In\nhis answer in chancery, he did say that he had an assignment; but he\ndid not say that it bore date the 20th May, 1828; but so far from it, he\nsaid on oath (for he swore to the answer) that as well as recollected,\nhe obtained it in 1827. If any one doubts, let him examine the circular\nand answer for himself. They are both accessible.\n\nIt will readily be observed that the principal part of Adams's defense\nrests upon the argument that if he had been base enough to forge an\nassignment he would not have been fool enough to forge one that would\nnot cover the case. This argument he used in his circular before the\nelection. The Republican has used it at least once, since then; and\nAdams uses it again in his publication of to-day. Now I pledge myself to\nshow that he is just such a fool that he and his friends have contended\nit was impossible for him to be. Recollect--he says he has a genuine\nassignment; and that he got Joseph Klein's affidavit, stating that he\nhad seen it, and that he believed the signature to have been executed\nby the same hand that signed Anderson's name to the answer in chancery.\nLuckily Klein took a copy of this genuine assignment, which I have been\npermitted to see; and hence I know it does not cover the case. In the\nfirst place it is headed \"Joseph Anderson vs. Joseph Miller,\" and heads\noff \"Judgment in Sangamon Circuit Court.\" Now, mark, there never was\na case in Sangamon Circuit Court entitled Joseph Anderson vs. Joseph\nMiller. The case mentioned in my former publication, and the only\none between these parties that ever existed in the Circuit Court, was\nentitled Joseph Miller vs. Joseph Anderson, Miller being the plaintiff.\nWhat then becomes of all their sophistry about Adams not being fool\nenough to forge an assignment that would not cover the case? It is\ncertain that the present one does not cover the case; and if he got\nit honestly, it is still clear that he was fool enough to pay for an\nassignment that does not cover the case.\n\nThe General asks for the proof of disinterested witnesses. Whom does he\nconsider disinterested? None can be more so than those who have already\ntestified against him. No one of them had the least interest on earth,\nso far as I can learn, to injure him. True, he says they had conspired\nagainst him; but if the testimony of an angel from Heaven were\nintroduced against him, he would make the same charge of conspiracy.\nAnd now I put the question to every reflecting man, Do you believe that\nBenjamin Talbott, Chas. R. Matheny, William Butler and Stephen T. Logan,\nall sustaining high and spotless characters, and justly proud of them,\nwould deliberately perjure themselves, without any motive whatever,\nexcept to injure a man's election; and that, too, a man who had been a\ncandidate, time out of mind, and yet who had never been elected to any\noffice?\n\nAdams's assurance, in demanding disinterested testimony, is surpassing.\nHe brings in the affidavit of his own son, and even of Peter S. Weber,\nwith whom I am not acquainted, but who, I suppose, is some black or\nmulatto boy, from his being kept in the kitchen, to prove his points;\nbut when such a man as Talbott, a man who, but two years ago, ran\nagainst Gen. Adams for the office of Recorder and beat him more than\nfour votes to one, is introduced against him, he asks the community,\nwith all the consequence of a lord, to reject his testimony.\n\nI might easily write a volume, pointing out inconsistencies between\nthe statements in Adams's last address with one another, and with other\nknown facts; but I am aware the reader must already be tired with\nthe length of this article. His opening statements, that he was first\naccused of being a Tory, and that he refuted that; that then the\nSampson's ghost story was got up, and he refuted that; that as a last\nresort, a dying effort, the assignment charge was got up is all as false\nas hell, as all this community must know. Sampson's ghost first made\nits appearance in print, and that, too, after Keys swears he saw the\nassignment, as any one may see by reference to the files of papers; and\nGen. Adams himself, in reply to the Sampson's ghost story, was the first\nman that raised the cry of toryism, and it was only by way of set-off,\nand never in seriousness, that it was bandied back at him. His effort is\nto make the impression that his enemies first made the charge of toryism\nand he drove them from that, then Sampson's ghost, he drove them from\nthat, then finally the assignment charge was manufactured just before\nelection. Now, the only general reply he ever made to the Sampson's\nghost and tory charges he made at one and the same time, and not in\nsuccession as he states; and the date of that reply will show, that it\nwas made at least a month after the date on which Keys swears he saw the\nAnderson assignment. But enough. In conclusion I will only say that I\nhave a character to defend as well as Gen. Adams, but I disdain to whine\nabout it as he does. It is true I have no children nor kitchen boys; and\nif I had, I should scorn to lug them in to make affidavits for me.\n\nA. LINCOLN, September 6, 1837.\n\nGen.

        "content": "Such is the turn which things have taken lately, that when Gen. Adams\nwrites a book, I am expected to write a commentary on it. In the\nRepublican of this morning he has presented the world with a new work\nof six columns in length; in consequence of which I must beg the room of\none column in the Journal. It is obvious that a minute reply cannot\nbe made in one column to everything that can be said in six; and,\nconsequently, I hope that expectation will be answered if I reply to\nsuch parts of the General's publication as are worth replying to.\n\nIt may not be improper to remind the reader that in his publication of\nSept. 6th General Adams said that the assignment charge was manufactured\njust before the election; and that in reply I proved that statement to\nbe false by Keys, his own witness. Now, without attempting to explain,\nhe furnishes me with another witness (Tinsley) by which the same thing\nis proved, to wit, that the assignment was not manufactured just before\nthe election; but that it was some weeks before. Let it be borne in mind\nthat Adams made this statement--has himself furnished two witnesses to\nprove its falsehood, and does not attempt to deny or explain it. Before\ngoing farther, let a pin be stuck here, labeled \"One lie proved and\nconfessed.\" On the 6th of September he said he had before stated in\nthe hand-bill that he held an assignment dated May 20th, 1828, which in\nreply I pronounced to be false, and referred to the hand-bill for the\ntruth of what I said. This week he forgets to make any explanation of\nthis. Let another pin be stuck here, labelled as before. I mention these\nthings because, if, when I convict him in one falsehood, he is permitted\nto shift his ground and pass it by in silence, there can be no end to\nthis controversy.\n\nThe first thing that attracts my attention in the General's present\nproduction is the information he is pleased to give to \"those who are\nmade to suffer at his (my) hands.\"\n\nUnder present circumstances, this cannot apply to me, for I am not\na widow nor an orphan: nor have I a wife or children who might by\npossibility become such. Such, however, I have no doubt, have been,\nand will again be made to suffer at his hands! Hands! Yes, they are\nthe mischievous agents. The next thing I shall notice is his favorite\nexpression, \"not of lawyers, doctors and others,\" which he is so fond of\napplying to all who dare expose his rascality. Now, let it be remembered\nthat when he first came to this country he attempted to impose himself\nupon the community as a lawyer, and actually carried the attempt so\nfar as to induce a man who was under a charge of murder to entrust the\ndefence of his life in his hands, and finally took his money and got\nhim hanged. Is this the man that is to raise a breeze in his favor by\nabusing lawyers? If he is not himself a lawyer, it is for the lack of\nsense, and not of inclination. If he is not a lawyer, he is a liar, for\nhe proclaimed himself a lawyer, and got a man hanged by depending on\nhim.\n\nPassing over such parts of the article as have neither fact nor argument\nin them, I come to the question asked by Adams whether any person ever\nsaw the assignment in his possession. This is an insult to common sense.\nTalbott has sworn once and repeated time and again, that he got it out\nof Adams's possession and returned it into the same possession. Still,\nas though he was addressing fools, he has assurance to ask if any person\never saw it in his possession.\n\nNext I quote a sentence, \"Now my son Lucian swears that when Talbott\ncalled for the deed, that he, Talbott, opened it and pointed out the\nerror.\" True. His son Lucian did swear as he says; and in doing so, he\nswore what I will prove by his own affidavit to be a falsehood. Turn to\nLucian's affidavit, and you will there see that Talbott called for the\ndeed by which to correct an error on the record. Thus it appears that\nthe error in question was on the record, and not in the deed. How then\ncould Talbott open the deed and point out the error? Where a thing is\nnot, it cannot be pointed out. The error was not in the deed, and of\ncourse could not be pointed out there. This does not merely prove that\nthe error could not be pointed out, as Lucian swore it was; but it\nproves, too, that the deed was not opened in his presence with a special\nview to the error, for if it had been, he could not have failed to see\nthat there was no error in it. It is easy enough to see why Lucian swore\nthis. His object was to prove that the assignment was not in the deed\nwhen Talbott got it: but it was discovered he could not swear this\nsafely, without first swearing the deed was opened--and if he swore it\nwas opened, he must show a motive for opening it, and the conclusion\nwith him and his father was that the pointing out the error would appear\nthe most plausible.\n\nFor the purpose of showing that the assignment was not in the bundle\nwhen Talbott got it, is the story introduced into Lucian's affidavit\nthat the deeds were counted. It is a remarkable fact, and one that\nshould stand as a warning to all liars and fabricators, that in this\nshort affidavit of Lucian's he only attempted to depart from the truth,\nso far as I have the means of knowing, in two points, to wit, in the\nopening the deed and pointing out the error and the counting of the\ndeeds,--and in both of these he caught himself. About the counting, he\ncaught himself thus--after saying the bundle contained five deeds and\na lease, he proceeds, \"and I saw no other papers than the said deed and\nlease.\" First he has six papers, and then he saw none but two; for \"my\nson Lucian's\" benefit, let a pin be stuck here.\n\nAdams again adduces the argument, that he could not have forged the\nassignment, for the reason that he could have had no motive for it. With\nthose that know the facts there is no absence of motive. Admitting the\npaper which he has filed in the suit to be genuine, it is clear that it\ncannot answer the purpose for which he designs it. Hence his motive for\nmaking one that he supposed would answer is obvious. His making the date\ntoo old is also easily enough accounted for. The records were not in his\nhands, and then, there being some considerable talk upon this particular\nsubject, he knew he could not examine the records to ascertain the\nprecise dates without subjecting himself to suspicion; and hence he\nconcluded to try it by guess, and, as it turned out, missed it a little.\nAbout Miller's deposition I have a word to say. In the first place,\nMiller's answer to the first question shows upon its face that he had\nbeen tampered with, and the answer dictated to him. He was asked if he\nknew Joel Wright and James Adams; and above three-fourths of his answer\nconsists of what he knew about Joseph Anderson, a man about whom nothing\nhad been asked, nor a word said in the question--a fact that can only be\naccounted for upon the supposition that Adams had secretly told him what\nhe wished him to swear to.\n\nAnother of Miller's answers I will prove both by common sense and the\nCourt of Record is untrue. To one question he answers, \"Anderson brought\na suit against me before James Adams, then an acting justice of the\npeace in Sangamon County, before whom he obtained a judgment.\n\n\"Q.--Did you remove the same by injunction to the Sangamon Circuit\nCourt? Ans.--I did remove it.\"\n\nNow mark--it is said he removed it by injunction. The word \"injunction\"\nin common language imports a command that some person or thing shall\nnot move or be removed; in law it has the same meaning. An injunction\nissuing out of chancery to a justice of the peace is a command to him to\nstop all proceedings in a named case until further orders. It is not an\norder to remove but to stop or stay something that is already moving.\nBesides this, the records of the Sangamon Circuit Court show that the\njudgment of which Miller swore was never removed into said Court by\ninjunction or otherwise."

It is in these words:\n\"I have now shown, in the opinion of two competent judges, that the\nhandwriting of the forged assignment differed from mine, and by one of\nthem that it could not be mistaken for mine.\" That is false. Tinsley no\ndoubt is the judge referred to; and by reference to his certificate it\nwill be seen that he did not say the handwriting of the assignment\ncould not be mistaken for Adams's--nor did he use any other expression\nsubstantially, or anything near substantially, the same. But if Tinsley\nhad said the handwriting could not be mistaken for Adams's, it would\nhave been equally unfortunate for Adams: for it then would have\ncontradicted Keys, who says, \"I looked at the writing and judged it the\nsaid Adams's or a good imitation.\"\n\nAdams speaks with much apparent confidence of his success on attending\nlawsuits, and the ultimate maintenance of his title to the land in\nquestion. Without wishing to disturb the pleasure of his dream, I would\nsay to him that it is not impossible that he may yet be taught to sing a\ndifferent song in relation to the matter.\n\nAt the end of Miller's deposition, Adams asks, \"Will Mr. Lincoln now say\nthat he is almost convinced my title to this ten acre tract of land\nis founded in fraud?\" I answer, I will not. I will now change the\nphraseology so as to make it run--I am quite convinced, &c. I cannot\npass in silence Adams's assertion that he has proved that the forged\nassignment was not in the deed when it came from his house by Talbott,\nthe recorder. In this, although Talbott has sworn that the assignment\nwas in the bundle of deeds when it came from his house, Adams has\nthe unaccountable assurance to say that he has proved the contrary by\nTalbott. Let him or his friends attempt to show wherein he proved any\nsuch thing by Talbott.\n\nIn his publication of the 6th of September he hinted to Talbott, that\nhe might be mistaken. In his present, speaking of Talbott and me he says\n\"They may have been imposed upon.\" Can any man of the least penetration\nfail to see the object of this? After he has stormed and raged till he\nhopes and imagines he has got us a little scared he wishes to softly\nwhisper in our ears, \"If you'll quit I will.\" If he could get us to say\nthat some unknown, undefined being had slipped the assignment into\nour hands without our knowledge, not a doubt remains but that he would\nimmediately discover that we were the purest men on earth. This is the\nground he evidently wishes us to understand he is willing to compromise\nupon. But we ask no such charity at his hands. We are neither mistaken\nnor imposed upon. We have made the statements we have because we know\nthem to be true and we choose to live or die by them.\n\nEsq. Carter, who is Adams's friend, personal and political, will\nrecollect, that, on the 5th of this month, he (Adams), with a great\naffectation of modesty, declared that he would never introduce his own\nchild as a witness. Notwithstanding this affectation of modesty, he has\nin his present publication introduced his child as witness; and as if to\nshow with how much contempt he could treat his own declaration, he\nhas had this same Esq. Carter to administer the oath to him. And so\nimportant a witness does he consider him, and so entirely does the whole\nof his entire present production depend upon the testimony of his child,\nthat in it he has mentioned \"my son,\" \"my son Lucian,\" \"Lucian, my son,\"\nand the like expressions no less than fifteen different times. Let it\nbe remembered here, that I have shown the affidavit of \"my darling son\nLucian\" to be false by the evidence apparent on its own face; and I now\nask if that affidavit be taken away what foundation will the fabric have\nleft to stand upon?\n\nGeneral Adams's publications and out-door maneuvering, taken in\nconnection with the editorial articles of the Republican, are not more\nfoolish and contradictory than they are ludicrous and amusing. One\nweek the Republican notifies the public that Gen. Adams is preparing\nan instrument that will tear, rend, split, rive, blow up, confound,\noverwhelm, annihilate, extinguish, exterminate, burst asunder, and grind\nto powder all its slanderers, and particularly Talbott and Lincoln--all\nof which is to be done in due time.\n\nThen for two or three weeks all is calm--not a word said. Again the\nRepublican comes forth with a mere passing remark that \"public\" opinion\nhas decided in favor of Gen. Adams, and intimates that he will give\nhimself no more trouble about the matter. In the meantime Adams himself\nis prowling about and, as Burns says of the devil, \"For prey, and holes\nand corners tryin',\" and in one instance goes so far as to take an old\nacquaintance of mine several steps from a crowd and, apparently weighed\ndown with the importance of his business, gravely and solemnly asks him\nif \"he ever heard Lincoln say he was a deist.\"\n\nAnon the Republican comes again. \"We invite the attention of the public\nto General Adams's communication,\" &c. \"The victory is a great one, the\ntriumph is overwhelming.\" I really believe the editor of the Illinois\nRepublican is fool enough to think General Adams leads off--\"Authors\nmost egregiously mistaken &c. Most woefully shall their presumption be\npunished,\" &c. (Lord have mercy on us.) \"The hour is yet to come, yea,\nnigh at hand--(how long first do you reckon?)--when the Journal and its\njunto shall say, I have appeared too early.\" \"Their infamy shall be laid\nbare to the public gaze.\" Suddenly the General appears to relent at the\nseverity with which he is treating us and he exclaims: \"The condemnation\nof my enemies is the inevitable result of my own defense.\" For your\nhealth's sake, dear Gen., do not permit your tenderness of heart to\nafflict you so much on our account. For some reason (perhaps because we\nare killed so quickly) we shall never be sensible of our suffering.\n\nFarewell, General. I will see you again at court if not before--when and\nwhere we will settle the question whether you or the widow shall have\nthe land.\n\nA. LINCOLN. October 18, 1837.\n\n1838\n\nTO Mrs. O. H.

        "content": "It was, then, in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of my\nacquaintance, and who was a great friend of mine, being about to pay a\nvisit to her father and other relatives residing in Kentucky, proposed\nto me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on\ncondition that I would engage to become her brother-in-law with all\nconvenient despatch. I, of course, accepted the proposal, for you know\nI could not have done otherwise had I really been averse to it; but\nprivately, between you and me, I was most confoundedly well pleased with\nthe project. I had seen the said sister some three years before, thought\nher intelligent and agreeable, and saw no good objection to plodding\nlife through hand in hand with her. Time passed on; the lady took her\njourney and in due time returned, sister in company, sure enough. This\nastonished me a little, for it appeared to me that her coming so readily\nshowed that she was a trifle too willing, but on reflection it occurred\nto me that she might have been prevailed on by her married sister to\ncome without anything concerning me ever having been mentioned to her,\nand so I concluded that if no other objection presented itself, I would\nconsent to waive this. All this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival\nin the neighborhood--for, be it remembered, I had not yet seen her,\nexcept about three years previous, as above mentioned. In a few days we\nhad an interview, and, although I had seen her before, she did not look\nas my imagination had pictured her. I knew she was over-size, but she\nnow appeared a fair match for Falstaff. I knew she was called an\n\"old maid,\" and I felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the\nappellation, but now, when I beheld her, I could not for my life avoid\nthinking of my mother; and this, not from withered features,--for\nher skin was too full of fat to permit of its contracting into\nwrinkles,--but from her want of teeth, weather-beaten appearance in\ngeneral, and from a kind of notion that ran in my head that nothing\ncould have commenced at the size of infancy and reached her present bulk\nin less than thirty-five or forty years; and in short, I was not at\nall pleased with her. But what could I do? I had told her sister that I\nwould take her for better or for worse, and I made a point of honor and\nconscience in all things to stick to my word especially if others had\nbeen induced to act on it which in this case I had no doubt they had,\nfor I was now fairly convinced that no other man on earth would have\nher, and hence the conclusion that they were bent on holding me to my\nbargain.\n\n\"Well,\" thought I, \"I have said it, and, be the consequences what they\nmay, it shall not be my fault if I fail to do it.\" At once I determined\nto consider her my wife; and, this done, all my powers of discovery were\nput to work in search of perfections in her which might be fairly set\noff against her defects. I tried to imagine her handsome, which, but\nfor her unfortunate corpulency, was actually true. Exclusive of this no\nwoman that I have ever seen has a finer face. I also tried to convince\nmyself that the mind was much more to be valued than the person; and in\nthis she was not inferior, as I could discover, to any with whom I had\nbeen acquainted.\n\nShortly after this, without coming to any positive understanding with\nher, I set out for Vandalia, when and where you first saw me. During\nmy stay there I had letters from her which did not change my opinion of\neither her intellect or intention, but on the contrary confirmed it in\nboth.\n\nAll this while, although I was fixed, \"firm as the surge-repelling\nrock,\" in my resolution, I found I was continually repenting the\nrashness which had led me to make it. Through life, I have been in no\nbondage, either real or imaginary, from the thraldom of which I so much\ndesired to be free. After my return home, I saw nothing to change my\nopinions of her in any particular. She was the same, and so was I. I now\nspent my time in planning how I might get along through life after my\ncontemplated change of circumstances should have taken place, and how I\nmight procrastinate the evil day for a time, which I really dreaded as\nmuch, perhaps more, than an Irishman does the halter.\n\nAfter all my suffering upon this deeply interesting subject, here I am,\nwholly, unexpectedly, completely, out of the \"scrape\"; and now I want to\nknow if you can guess how I got out of it----out, clear, in every sense\nof the term; no violation of word, honor, or conscience. I don't believe\nyou can guess, and so I might as well tell you at once. As the lawyer\nsays, it was done in the manner following, to wit: After I had delayed\nthe matter as long as I thought I could in honor do (which, by the way,\nhad brought me round into the last fall), I concluded I might as well\nbring it to a consummation without further delay; and so I mustered\nmy resolution, and made the proposal to her direct; but, shocking to\nrelate, she answered, No. At first I supposed she did it through an\naffectation of modesty, which I thought but ill became her under the\npeculiar circumstances of her case; but on my renewal of the charge,\nI found she repelled it with greater firmness than before. I tried it\nagain and again but with the same success, or rather with the same want\nof success.\n\nI finally was forced to give it up; at which I very unexpectedly found\nmyself mortified almost beyond endurance. I was mortified, it seemed\nto me, in a hundred different ways. My vanity was deeply wounded by the\nreflection that I had been too stupid to discover her intentions, and at\nthe same time never doubting that I understood them perfectly, and also\nthat she, whom I had taught myself to believe nobody else would have,\nhad actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness. And, to cap the\nwhole, I then for the first time began to suspect that I was really a\nlittle in love with her. But let it all go. I'll try and outlive it.\nOthers have been made fools of by the girls, but this can never with\ntruth be said of me. I most emphatically in this instance, made a fool\nof myself. I have now come to the conclusion never again to think of\nmarrying, and for this reason: I can never be satisfied with any one who\nwould be blockhead enough to have me.\n\nWhen you receive this, write me a long yarn about something to amuse me.\nGive my respects to Mr. Browning.\n\nYour sincere friend, A. LINCOLN.\n\n1839\n\nREMARKS ON SALE OF PUBLIC LANDS\n\nIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, January 17, 1839.\n\nMr. Lincoln, from Committee on Finance, to which the subject was\nreferred, made a report on the subject of purchasing of the United\nStates all the unsold lands lying within the limits of the State of\nIllinois, accompanied by resolutions that this State propose to purchase\nall unsold lands at twenty-five cents per acre, and pledging the faith\nof the State to carry the proposal into effect if the government accept\nthe same within two years.\n\nMr. Lincoln thought the resolutions ought to be seriously considered. In\nreply to the gentleman from Adams, he said that it was not to enrich the\nState. The price of the lands may be raised, it was thought by some; by\nothers, that it would be reduced. The conclusion in his mind was that\nthe representatives in this Legislature from the country in which\nthe lands lie would be opposed to raising the price, because it would\noperate against the settlement of the lands. He referred to the lands in\nthe military tract. They had fallen into the hands of large speculators\nin consequence of the low price. He was opposed to a low price of land.\nHe thought it was adverse to the interests of the poor settler, because\nspeculators buy them up. He was opposed to a reduction of the price of\npublic lands."

        "content": "Mr. Lincoln referred to some official documents emanating from Indiana,\nand compared the progressive population of the two States. Illinois\nhad gained upon that State under the public land system as it is. His\nconclusion was that ten years from this time Illinois would have no more\npublic land unsold than Indiana now has. He referred also to Ohio. That\nState had sold nearly all her public lands. She was but twenty years\nahead of us, and as our lands were equally salable--more so, as he\nmaintained--we should have no more twenty years from now than she has at\npresent.\n\nMr. Lincoln referred to the canal lands, and supposed that the policy of\nthe State would be different in regard to them, if the representatives\nfrom that section of country could themselves choose the policy; but the\nrepresentatives from other parts of the State had a veto upon it, and\nregulated the policy. He thought that if the State had all the lands,\nthe policy of the Legislature would be more liberal to all sections.\n\nHe referred to the policy of the General Government.

The Dr.\novertook me between Rushville and Beardstown.\n\nHe, after learning that I had lived at Springfield, asked if I was\nacquainted with you. I told him I was. He said you had lately been\nelected constable in Adams, but that you never would be again. I asked\nhim why. He said the people there had found out that you had been\nsheriff or deputy sheriff in Sangamon County, and that you came off and\nleft your securities to suffer. He then asked me if I did not know such\nto be the fact. I told him I did not think you had ever been sheriff or\ndeputy sheriff in Sangamon, but that I thought you had been constable. I\nfurther told him that if you had left your securities to suffer in that\nor any other case, I had never heard of it, and that if it had been so,\nI thought I would have heard of it.\n\nIf the Dr. is telling that I told him anything against you whatever, I\nauthorize you to contradict it flatly.

LINCOLN.\n\nSPEECH ON NATIONAL BANK\n\nIN THE HALL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, December 20, 1839.\n\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--It is peculiarly embarrassing to me to attempt a\ncontinuance of the discussion, on this evening, which has been conducted\nin this hall on several preceding ones. It is so because on each of\nthose evenings there was a much fuller attendance than now, without any\nreason for its being so, except the greater interest the community feel\nin the speakers who addressed them then than they do in him who is to do\nso now. I am, indeed, apprehensive that the few who have attended\nhave done so more to spare me mortification than in the hope of being\ninterested in anything I may be able to say. This circumstance casts\na damp upon my spirits, which I am sure I shall be unable to overcome\nduring the evening. But enough of preface.\n\nThe subject heretofore and now to be discussed is the subtreasury scheme\nof the present administration, as a means of collecting, safe-keeping,\ntransferring, and disbursing, the revenues of the nation, as contrasted\nwith a national bank for the same purposes. Mr. Douglas has said that we\n(the Whigs) have not dared to meet them (the Locos) in argument on this\nquestion. I protest against this assertion. I assert that we have again\nand again, during this discussion, urged facts and arguments against\nthe subtreasury which they have neither dared to deny nor attempted to\nanswer. But lest some may be led to believe that we really wish to avoid\nthe question, I now propose, in my humble way, to urge those arguments\nagain; at the same time begging the audience to mark well the positions\nI shall take and the proof I shall offer to sustain them, and that they\nwill not again permit Mr. Douglas or his friends to escape the force of\nthem by a round and groundless assertion that we \"dare not meet them in\nargument.\"\n\nOf the subtreasury, then, as contrasted with a national bank for the\nbefore-enumerated purposes, I lay down the following propositions, to\nwit: (1) It will injuriously affect the community by its operation on\nthe circulating medium. (2) It will be a more expensive fiscal agent.\n(3) It will be a less secure depository of the public money. To show\nthe truth of the first proposition, let us take a short review of our\ncondition under the operation of a national bank. It was the depository\nof the public revenues. Between the collection of those revenues and the\ndisbursement of them by the government, the bank was permitted to and\ndid actually loan them out to individuals, and hence the large amount of\nmoney actually collected for revenue purposes, which by any other\nplan would have been idle a great portion of the time, was kept almost\nconstantly in circulation. Any person who will reflect that money is\nonly valuable while in circulation will readily perceive that any device\nwhich will keep the government revenues in constant circulation, instead\nof being locked up in idleness, is no inconsiderable advantage. By the\nsubtreasury the revenue is to be collected and kept in iron boxes until\nthe government wants it for disbursement; thus robbing the people of the\nuse of it, while the government does not itself need it, and while the\nmoney is performing no nobler office than that of rusting in iron boxes.\nThe natural effect of this change of policy, every one will see, is\nto reduce the quantity of money in circulation. But, again, by\nthe subtreasury scheme the revenue is to be collected in specie. I\nanticipate that this will be disputed. I expect to hear it said that\nit is not the policy of the administration to collect the revenue\nin specie. If it shall, I reply that Mr. Van Buren, in his message\nrecommending the subtreasury, expended nearly a column of that document\nin an attempt to persuade Congress to provide for the collection of the\nrevenue in specie exclusively; and he concludes with these words:"

        "content": "\"It may be safely assumed that no motive of convenience to the citizens\nrequires the reception of bank paper.\" In addition to this, Mr.\nSilas Wright, Senator from New York, and the political, personal and\nconfidential friend of Mr. Van Buren, drafted and introduced into the\nSenate the first subtreasury bill, and that bill provided for ultimately\ncollecting the revenue in specie. It is true, I know, that that clause\nwas stricken from the bill, but it was done by the votes of the Whigs,\naided by a portion only of the Van Buren senators. No subtreasury\nbill has yet become a law, though two or three have been considered by\nCongress, some with and some without the specie clause; so that I\nadmit there is room for quibbling upon the question of whether the\nadministration favor the exclusive specie doctrine or not; but I take it\nthat the fact that the President at first urged the specie doctrine,\nand that under his recommendation the first bill introduced embraced it,\nwarrants us in charging it as the policy of the party until their head\nas publicly recants it as he at first espoused it. I repeat, then, that\nby the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected in specie. Now mark\nwhat the effect of this must be. By all estimates ever made there are\nbut between sixty and eighty millions of specie in the United States.\nThe expenditures of the Government for the year 1838--the last for which\nwe have had the report--were forty millions. Thus it is seen that if the\nwhole revenue be collected in specie, it will take more than half of all\nthe specie in the nation to do it. By this means more than half of all\nthe specie belonging to the fifteen millions of souls who compose the\nwhole population of the country is thrown into the hands of the public\noffice-holders, and other public creditors comprising in number perhaps\nnot more than one quarter of a million, leaving the other fourteen\nmillions and three quarters to get along as they best can, with less\nthan one half of the specie of the country, and whatever rags and\nshinplasters they may be able to put, and keep, in circulation. By\nthis means, every office-holder and other public creditor may, and\nmost likely will, set up shaver; and a most glorious harvest will the\nspecie-men have of it,--each specie-man, upon a fair division, having to\nhis share the fleecing of about fifty-nine rag-men. In all candor let me\nask, was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many\never before devised? And was the sacred name of Democracy ever before\nmade to indorse such an enormity against the rights of the people?\n\nI have already said that the subtreasury will reduce the quantity of\nmoney in circulation. This position is strengthened by the recollection\nthat the revenue is to be collected in Specie, so that the mere amount\nof revenue is not all that is withdrawn, but the amount of paper\ncirculation that the forty millions would serve as a basis to is\nwithdrawn, which would be in a sound state at least one hundred\nmillions. When one hundred millions, or more, of the circulation we\nnow have shall be withdrawn, who can contemplate without terror the\ndistress, ruin, bankruptcy, and beggary that must follow? The man\nwho has purchased any article--say a horse--on credit, at one hundred\ndollars, when there are two hundred millions circulating in the country,\nif the quantity be reduced to one hundred millions by the arrival of\npay-day, will find the horse but sufficient to pay half the debt; and\nthe other half must either be paid out of his other means, and thereby\nbecome a clear loss to him, or go unpaid, and thereby become a clear\nloss to his creditor. What I have here said of a single case of the\npurchase of a horse will hold good in every case of a debt existing at\nthe time a reduction in the quantity of money occurs, by whomsoever, and\nfor whatsoever, it may have been contracted. It may be said that\nwhat the debtor loses the creditor gains by this operation; but on\nexamination this will be found true only to a very limited extent. It is\nmore generally true that all lose by it--the creditor by losing more of\nhis debts than he gains by the increased value of those he collects; the\ndebtor by either parting with more of his property to pay his debts\nthan he received in contracting them, or by entirely breaking up his\nbusiness, and thereby being thrown upon the world in idleness.\n\nThe general distress thus created will, to be sure, be temporary,\nbecause, whatever change may occur in the quantity of money in any\ncommunity, time will adjust the derangement produced; but while that\nadjustment is progressing, all suffer more or less, and very many lose\neverything that renders life desirable. Why, then, shall we suffer a\nsevere difficulty, even though it be but temporary, unless we receive\nsome equivalent for it?\n\nWhat I have been saying as to the effect produced by a reduction of the\nquantity of money relates to the whole country. I now propose to\nshow that it would produce a peculiar and permanent hardship upon the\ncitizens of those States and Territories in which the public lands lie.\nThe land-offices in those States and Territories, as all know, form the\ngreat gulf by which all, or nearly all, the money in them is swallowed\nup. When the quantity of money shall be reduced, and consequently\neverything under individual control brought down in proportion, the\nprice of those lands, being fixed by law, will remain as now. Of\nnecessity it will follow that the produce or labor that now raises money\nsufficient to purchase eighty acres will then raise but sufficient\nto purchase forty, or perhaps not that much; and this difficulty and\nhardship will last as long, in some degree, as any portion of these\nlands shall remain undisposed of. Knowing, as I well do, the difficulty\nthat poor people now encounter in procuring homes, I hesitate not to say\nthat when the price of the public lands shall be doubled or trebled, or,\nwhich is the same thing, produce and labor cut down to one half or one\nthird of their present prices, it will be little less than impossible\nfor them to procure those homes at all....\n\nWell, then, what did become of him? (Postmaster General Barry) Why, the\nPresident immediately expressed his high disapprobation of his almost\nunequaled incapacity and corruption by appointing him to a foreign\nmission, with a salary and outfit of $18,000 a year! The party now\nattempt to throw Barry off, and to avoid the responsibility of his sins.\nDid not the President indorse those sins when, on the very heel of\ntheir commission, he appointed their author to the very highest and most\nhonorable office in his gift, and which is but a single step behind the\nvery goal of American political ambition?"

But when he went on to\nsay that five millions of the expenditure of 1838 were payments of the\nFrench indemnities, which I knew to be untrue; that five millions had\nbeen for the post-office, which I knew to be untrue; that ten millions\nhad been for the Maine boundary war, which I not only knew to be untrue,\nbut supremely ridiculous also; and when I saw that he was stupid enough\nto hope that I would permit such groundless and audacious assertions to\ngo unexposed,--I readily consented that, on the score both of veracity\nand sagacity, the audience should judge whether he or I were the more\ndeserving of the world's contempt.\n\nMr. Lamborn insists that the difference between the Van Buren party and\nthe Whigs is that, although the former sometimes err in practice,\nthey are always correct in principle, whereas the latter are wrong in\nprinciple; and, better to impress this proposition, he uses a figurative\nexpression in these words: \"The Democrats are vulnerable in the heel,\nbut they are sound in the head and the heart.\" The first branch of the\nfigure--that is, that the Democrats are vulnerable in the heel--I admit\nis not merely figuratively, but literally true. Who that looks but for\na moment at their Swartwouts, their Prices, their Harringtons, and their\nhundreds of others, scampering away with the public money to Texas, to\nEurope, and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find\nrefuge from justice, can at all doubt that they are most distressingly\naffected in their heels with a species of \"running itch\"? It seems\nthat this malady of their heels operates on these sound-headed and\nhonest-hearted creatures very much like the cork leg in the comic song\ndid on its owner: which, when he had once got started on it, the more he\ntried to stop it, the more it would run away. At the hazard of wearing\nthis point threadbare, I will relate an anecdote which seems too\nstrikingly in point to be omitted. A witty Irish soldier, who was always\nboasting of his bravery when no danger was near, but who invariably\nretreated without orders at the first charge of an engagement, being\nasked by his captain why he did so, replied: \"Captain, I have as brave a\nheart as Julius Caesar ever had; but, somehow or other, whenever\ndanger approaches, my cowardly legs will run away with it.\" So with Mr.\nLamborn's party. They take the public money into their hand for the\nmost laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts can dictate; but\nbefore they can possibly get it out again, their rascally \"vulnerable\nheels\" will run away with them.\n\nSeriously this proposition of Mr. Lamborn is nothing more or less than\na request that his party may be tried by their professions instead of\ntheir practices. Perhaps no position that the party assumes is more\nliable to or more deserving of exposure than this very modest request;\nand nothing but the unwarrantable length to which I have already\nextended these remarks forbids me now attempting to expose it. For the\nreason given, I pass it by.\n\nI shall advert to but one more point. Mr. Lamborn refers to the late\nelections in the States, and from their results confidently predicts\nthat every State in the Union will vote for Mr. Van Buren at the next\nPresidential election. Address that argument to cowards and to knaves;\nwith the free and the brave it will effect nothing. It may be true; if\nit must, let it. Many free countries have lost their liberty, and ours\nmay lose hers; but if she shall, be it my proudest plume, not that I was\nthe last to desert, but that I never deserted her. I know that the great\nvolcano at Washington, aroused and directed by the evil spirit that\nreigns there, is belching forth the lava of political corruption in a\ncurrent broad and deep, which is sweeping with frightful velocity\nover the whole length and breadth of the land, bidding fair to leave\nunscathed no green spot or living thing; while on its bosom are riding,\nlike demons on the waves of hell, the imps of that evil spirit, and\nfiendishly taunting all those who dare resist its destroying course with\nthe hopelessness of their effort; and, knowing this, I cannot deny that\nall may be swept away. Broken by it I, too, may be; bow to it I never\nwill. The probability that we may fall in the struggle ought not to\ndeter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just; it shall not\ndeter me. If ever I feel the soul within me elevate and expand to those\ndimensions not wholly unworthy of its almighty Architect, it is when I\ncontemplate the cause of my country deserted by all the world beside,\nand I standing up boldly and alone, and hurling defiance at her\nvictorious oppressors. Here, without contemplating consequences, before\nhigh heaven and in the face of the world, I swear eternal fidelity to\nthe just cause, as I deem it, of the land of my life, my liberty, and\nmy love. And who that thinks with me will not fearlessly adopt the oath\nthat I take? Let none falter who thinks he is right, and we may succeed.\nBut if, after all, we shall fail, be it so. We still shall have the\nproud consolation of saying to our consciences, and to the departed\nshade of our country's freedom, that the cause approved of our judgment,\nand adored of our hearts, in disaster, in chains, in torture, in death,\nwe never faltered in defending.\n\nTO JOHN T. STUART.\n\nSPRINGFIELD, December 23, 1839.\n\nDEAR STUART:\n\nDr. Henry will write you all the political news. I write this about some\nlittle matters of business. You recollect you told me you had drawn the\nChicago Masark money, and sent it to the claimants. A hawk-billed Yankee\nis here besetting me at every turn I take, saying that Robert Kinzie\nnever received the eighty dollars to which he was entitled. Can you tell\nme anything about the matter? Again, old Mr. Wright, who lives up South\nFork somewhere, is teasing me continually about some deeds which he says\nhe left with you, but which I can find nothing of. Can you tell me where\nthey are? The Legislature is in session and has suffered the bank to\nforfeit its charter without benefit of clergy. There seems to be little\ndisposition to resuscitate it.\n\nWhenever a letter comes from you to Mrs.____________ I carry it to her,\nand then I see Betty; she is a tolerable nice \"fellow\" now. Maybe I will\nwrite again when I get more time.\n\nYour friend as ever, A. LINCOLN\n\nP. S.--The Democratic giant is here, but he is not much worth talking\nabout.

        "content": "GENTLEMEN:--In obedience to a resolution of the Whig State convention,\nwe have appointed you the Central Whig Committee of your county. The\ntrust confided to you will be one of watchfulness and labor; but we hope\nthe glory of having contributed to the overthrow of the corrupt powers\nthat now control our beloved country will be a sufficient reward for the\ntime and labor you will devote to it. Our Whig brethren throughout the\nUnion have met in convention, and after due deliberation and\nmutual concessions have elected candidates for the Presidency and\nVice-Presidency not only worthy of our cause, but worthy of the support\nof every true patriot who would have our country redeemed, and her\ninstitutions honestly and faithfully administered. To overthrow the\ntrained bands that are opposed to us whose salaried officers are ever\non the watch, and whose misguided followers are ever ready to obey their\nsmallest commands, every Whig must not only know his duty, but must\nfirmly resolve, whatever of time and labor it may cost, boldly and\nfaithfully to do it. Our intention is to organize the whole State, so\nthat every Whig can be brought to the polls in the coming Presidential\ncontest. We cannot do this, however, without your co-operation; and\nas we do our duty, so we shall expect you to do yours. After due\ndeliberation, the following is the plan of organization, and the duties\nrequired of each county committee:\n\n(1) To divide their county into small districts, and to appoint in each\na subcommittee, whose duty it shall be to make a perfect list of all the\nvoters in their respective districts, and to ascertain with certainty\nfor whom they will vote. If they meet with men who are doubtful as to\nthe man they will support, such voters should be designated in separate\nlines, with the name of the man they will probably support.\n\n(2) It will be the duty of said subcommittee to keep a constant watch on\nthe doubtful voters, and from time to time have them talked to by those\nin whom they have the most confidence, and also to place in their hands\nsuch documents as will enlighten and influence them.\n\n(3) It will also be their duty to report to you, at least once a month,\nthe progress they are making, and on election days see that every Whig\nis brought to the polls.\n\n(4) The subcommittees should be appointed immediately; and by the last\nof April, at least, they should make their first report.\n\n(5) On the first of each month hereafter we shall expect to hear from\nyou. After the first report of your subcommittees, unless there should\nbe found a great many doubtful voters, you can tell pretty accurately\nthe manner in which your county will vote. In each of your letters to\nus, you will state the number of certain votes both for and against us,\nas well as the number of doubtful votes, with your opinion of the manner\nin which they will be cast.\n\n(6) When we have heard from all the counties, we shall be able to\ntell with similar accuracy the political complexion of the State. This\ninformation will be forwarded to you as soon as received.\n\n(7) Inclosed is a prospectus for a newspaper to be continued until after\nthe Presidential election. It will be superintended by ourselves, and\nevery Whig in the State must take it. It will be published so low that\nevery one can afford it. You must raise a fund and forward us for extra\ncopies,--every county ought to send--fifty or one hundred dollars,--and\nthe copies will be forwarded to you for distribution among our political\nopponents. The paper will be devoted exclusively to the great cause\nin which we are engaged. Procure subscriptions, and forward them to us\nimmediately.\n\n(8) Immediately after any election in your county, you must inform us of\nits results; and as early as possible after any general election we will\ngive you the like information.\n\n(9) A senator in Congress is to be elected by our next Legislature. Let\nno local interests divide you, but select candidates that can succeed.\n\n(10) Our plan of operations will of course be concealed from every one\nexcept our good friends who of right ought to know them.\n\nTrusting much in our good cause, the strength of our candidates, and\nthe determination of the Whigs everywhere to do their duty, we go to\nthe work of organization in this State confident of success. We have\nthe numbers, and if properly organized and exerted, with the gallant\nHarrison at our head, we shall meet our foes and conquer them in all\nparts of the Union.\n\nAddress your letters to Dr. A. G. Henry, R. F, Barrett; A. Lincoln, E."

We shall carry this county by a larger majority than\nwe did in 1836, when you ran against May. I do not think my prospects,\nindividually, are very flattering, for I think it probable I shall\nnot be permitted to be a candidate; but the party ticket will succeed\ntriumphantly. Subscriptions to the \"Old Soldier\" pour in without\nabatement. This morning I took from the post office a letter from Dubois\nenclosing the names of sixty subscribers, and on carrying it to Francis\nI found he had received one hundred and forty more from other quarters\nby the same day's mail. That is but an average specimen of every day's\nreceipts. Yesterday Douglas, having chosen to consider himself insulted\nby something in the Journal, undertook to cane Francis in the street.\nFrancis caught him by the hair and jammed him back against a market cart\nwhere the matter ended by Francis being pulled away from him. The\nwhole affair was so ludicrous that Francis and everybody else (Douglass\nexcepted) have been laughing about it ever since.\n\nI send you the names of some of the V.B. men who have come out for\nHarrison about town, and suggest that you send them some documents.\n\nMoses Coffman (he let us appoint him a delegate yesterday), Aaron\nCoffman, George Gregory, H. M. Briggs, Johnson (at Birchall's\nBookstore), Michael Glyn, Armstrong (not Hosea nor Hugh, but a\ncarpenter), Thomas Hunter, Moses Pileher (he was always a Whig and\ndeserves attention), Matthew Crowder Jr., Greenberry Smith; John Fagan,\nGeorge Fagan, William Fagan (these three fell out with us about Early,\nand are doubtful now), John M. Cartmel, Noah Rickard, John Rickard,\nWalter Marsh.\n\nThe foregoing should be addressed at Springfield.\n\nAlso send some to Solomon Miller and John Auth at Salisbury. Also to\nCharles Harper, Samuel Harper, and B. C. Harper, and T. J. Scroggins,\nJohn Scroggins at Pulaski, Logan County.\n\nSpeed says he wrote you what Jo Smith said about you as he passed here.\nWe will procure the names of some of his people here, and send them to\nyou before long. Speed also says you must not fail to send us the New\nYork Journal he wrote for some time since.\n\nEvan Butler is jealous that you never send your compliments to him. You\nmust not neglect him next time.\n\nYour friend, as ever, A. LINCOLN\n\nRESOLUTION IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\n\nNovember 28, 1840.\n\nIn the Illinois House of Representatives, November 28, 1840, Mr. Lincoln\noffered the following:\n\nResolved, That so much of the governor's message as relates to\nfraudulent voting, and other fraudulent practices at elections, be\nreferred to the Committee on Elections, with instructions to said\ncommittee to prepare and report to the House a bill for such an act as\nmay in their judgment afford the greatest possible protection of the\nelective franchise against all frauds of all sorts whatever.\n\nRESOLUTION IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\n\nDecember 2, 1840.\n\nResolved, That the Committee on Education be instructed to inquire\ninto the expediency of providing by law for the examination as to the\nqualification of persons offering themselves as school teachers, that no\nteacher shall receive any part of the public school fund who shall not\nhave successfully passed such examination, and that they report by bill\nor otherwise.\n\nREMARKS IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\n\nDecember 4, 1840\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Illinois, December 4, 1840, on\npresentation of a report respecting petition of H. N. Purple, claiming\nthe seat of Mr. Phelps from Peoria, Mr. Lincoln moved that the House\nresolve itself into Committee of the Whole on the question, and take\nit up immediately. Mr. Lincoln considered the question of the highest\nimportance whether an individual had a right to sit in this House or\nnot. The course he should propose would be to take up the evidence and\ndecide upon the facts seriatim.\n\nMr. Drummond wanted time; they could not decide in the heat of debate,\netc.\n\nMr. Lincoln thought that the question had better be gone into now.\nIn courts of law jurors were required to decide on evidence, without\nprevious study or examination. They were required to know nothing of\nthe subject until the evidence was laid before them for their immediate\ndecision. He thought that the heat of party would be augmented by delay.\n\nThe Speaker called Mr. Lincoln to order as being irrelevant; no mention\nhad been made of party heat.\n\nMr. Drummond said he had only spoken of debate. Mr. Lincoln asked what\ncaused the heat, if it was not party? Mr. Lincoln concluded by urging\nthat the question would be decided now better than hereafter, and he\nthought with less heat and excitement.\n\n(Further debate, in which Lincoln participated.)\n\nREMARKS IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\n\nDecember 4, 1840.\n\nIn the Illinois House of Representatives, December 4, 1840, House in\nCommittee of the Whole on the bill providing for payment of interest on\nthe State debt,--Mr. Lincoln moved to strike out the body and amendments\nof the bill, and insert in lieu thereof an amendment which in substance\nwas that the governor be authorized to issue bonds for the payment of\nthe interest; that these be called \"interest bonds\"; that the taxes\naccruing on Congress lands as they become taxable be irrevocably set\naside and devoted as a fund to the payment of the interest bonds. Mr.\nLincoln went into the reasons which appeared to him to render this plan\npreferable to that of hypothecating the State bonds. By this course we\ncould get along till the next meeting of the Legislature, which was\nof great importance. To the objection which might be urged that these\ninterest bonds could not be cashed, he replied that if our other bonds\ncould, much more could these, which offered a perfect security, a fund\nbeing irrevocably set aside to provide for their redemption. To another\nobjection, that we should be paying compound interest, he would reply\nthat the rapid growth and increase of our resources was in so great a\nratio as to outstrip the difficulty; that his object was to do the best\nthat could be done in the present emergency. All agreed that the faith\nof the State must be preserved; this plan appeared to him preferable\nto a hypothecation of bonds, which would have to be redeemed and the\ninterest paid. How this was to be done, he could not see; therefore he\nhad, after turning the matter over in every way, devised this measure,\nwhich would carry us on till the next Legislature.\n\n(Mr. Lincoln spoke at some length, advocating his measure.)\n\nLincoln advocated his measure, December 11, 1840.\n\nDecember 12, 1840, he had thought some permanent provision ought to be\nmade for the bonds to be hypothecated, but was satisfied taxation and\nrevenue could not be connected with it now.\n\n1841\n\nTO JOHN T. STUART--ON DEPRESSION\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Jan 23, 1841\n\nDEAR STUART: I am now the most miserable man living. If what I feel were\nequally distributed to the whole human family, there would not be one\ncheerful face on earth. Whether I shall ever be better, I cannot tell; I\nawfully forbode I shall not. To remain as I am is impossible. I must die\nor be better, as it appears to me.... I fear I shall be unable to attend\nany business here, and a change of scene might help me. If I could be\nmyself, I would rather remain at home with Judge Logan. I can write no\nmore.\n\nREMARKS IN THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE.\n\nJanuary 23, 1841\n\nIn the House of Representatives January 23, 1841, while discussing the\ncontinuation of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, Mr. Moore was afraid\nthe holders of the \"scrip\" would lose."

        "content": "Mr. Napier thought there was no danger of that; and Mr. Lincoln said he\nhad not examined to see what amount of scrip would probably be needed.\nThe principal point in his mind was this, that nobody was obliged to\ntake these certificates. It is altogether voluntary on their part, and\nif they apprehend it will fall in their hands they will not take it.\nFurther the loss, if any there be, will fall on the citizens of that\nsection of the country.\n\nThis scrip is not going to circulate over an extensive range of country,\nbut will be confined chiefly to the vicinity of the canal. Now, we find\nthe representatives of that section of the country are all in favor of\nthe bill.\n\nWhen we propose to protect their interests, they say to us: Leave us\nto take care of ourselves; we are willing to run the risk. And this\nis reasonable; we must suppose they are competent to protect their own\ninterests, and it is only fair to let them do it.\n\nCIRCULAR FROM WHIG COMMITTEE.\n\nFebruary 9, 1841.\n\nAppeal to the People of the State of Illinois.\n\nFELLOW-CITIZENS:--When the General Assembly, now about adjourning,\nassembled in November last, from the bankrupt state of the public\ntreasury, the pecuniary embarrassments prevailing in every department\nof society, the dilapidated state of the public works, and the impending\ndanger of the degradation of the State, you had a right to expect\nthat your representatives would lose no time in devising and adopting\nmeasures to avert threatened calamities, alleviate the distresses of\nthe people, and allay the fearful apprehensions in regard to the future\nprosperity of the State. It was not expected by you that the spirit of\nparty would take the lead in the councils of the State, and make every\ninterest bend to its demands. Nor was it expected that any party would\nassume to itself the entire control of legislation, and convert the\nmeans and offices of the State, and the substance of the people, into\naliment for party subsistence. Neither could it have been expected by\nyou that party spirit, however strong its desires and unreasonable\nits demands, would have passed the sanctuary of the Constitution, and\nentered with its unhallowed and hideous form into the formation of the\njudiciary system.\n\nAt the early period of the session, measures were adopted by the\ndominant party to take possession of the State, to fill all public\noffices with party men, and make every measure affecting the interests\nof the people and the credit of the State operate in furtherance of\ntheir party views. The merits of men and measures therefore became the\nsubject of discussion in caucus, instead of the halls of legislation,\nand decisions there made by a minority of the Legislature have been\nexecuted and carried into effect by the force of party discipline,\nwithout any regard whatever to the rights of the people or the interests\nof the State. The Supreme Court of the State was organized, and judges\nappointed, according to the provisions of the Constitution, in 1824.\nThe people have never complained of the organization of that court; no\nattempt has ever before been made to change that department. Respect for\npublic opinion, and regard for the rights and liberties of the people,\nhave hitherto restrained the spirit of party from attacks upon the\nindependence and integrity of the judiciary. The same judges have\ncontinued in office since 1824; their decisions have not been the\nsubject of complaint among the people; the integrity and honesty of the\ncourt have not been questioned, and it has never been supposed that\nthe court has ever permitted party prejudice or party considerations\nto operate upon their decisions. The court was made to consist of four\njudges, and by the Constitution two form a quorum for the transaction\nof business. With this tribunal, thus constituted, the people have\nbeen satisfied for near sixteen years. The same law which organized the\nSupreme Court in 1824 also established and organized circuit courts\nto be held in each county in the State, and five circuit judges were\nappointed to hold those courts. In 1826 the Legislature abolished these\ncircuit courts, repealed the judges out of office, and required the\njudges of the Supreme Court to hold the circuit courts. The reasons\nassigned for this change were, first, that the business of the country\ncould be better attended to by the four judges of the Supreme Court than\nby the two sets of judges; and, second, the state of the public treasury\nforbade the employment of unnecessary officers. In 1828 a circuit was\nestablished north of the Illinois River, in order to meet the wants of\nthe people, and a circuit judge was appointed to hold the courts in that\ncircuit.\n\nIn 1834 the circuit-court system was again established throughout the\nState, circuit judges appointed to hold the courts, and the judges of\nthe Supreme Court were relieved from the performance of circuit court\nduties. The change was recommended by the then acting governor of the\nState, General W. L. D. Ewing, in the following terms:\n\n\"The augmented population of the State, the multiplied number of\norganized counties, as well as the increase of business in all, has\nlong since convinced every one conversant with this department of\nour government of the indispensable necessity of an alteration in\nour judiciary system, and the subject is therefore recommended to the\nearnest patriotic consideration of the Legislature. The present system\nhas never been exempt from serious and weighty objections. The idea of\nappealing from the circuit court to the same judges in the Supreme Court\nis recommended by little hopes of redress to the injured party below.\nThe duties of the circuit, too, it may be added, consume one half of the\nyear, leaving a small and inadequate portion of time (when that required\nfor domestic purposes is deducted) to erect, in the decisions of the\nSupreme Court, a judicial monument of legal learning and research,\nwhich the talent and ability of the court might otherwise be entirely\ncompetent to.\"\n\nWith this organization of circuit courts the people have never\ncomplained. The only complaints which we have heard have come from\ncircuits which were so large that the judges could not dispose of the\nbusiness, and the circuits in which Judges Pearson and Ralston lately\npresided."

Yet the party in power,\nneglecting every interest requiring legislative action, and wholly\ndisregarding the rights, wishes, and interests of the people, has, for\nthe unholy purpose of providing places for its partisans and supplying\nthem with large salaries, disorganized that department of the\ngovernment. Provision is made for the election of five party judges\nof the Supreme Court, the proscription of four circuit judges, and the\nappointment of party clerks in more than half the counties of the\nState. Men professing respect for public opinion, and acknowledged to be\nleaders of the party, have avowed in the halls of legislation that\nthe change in the judiciary was intended to produce political results\nfavorable to their party and party friends. The immutable principles\nof justice are to make way for party interests, and the bonds of social\norder are to be rent in twain, in order that a desperate faction may\nbe sustained at the expense of the people. The change proposed in the\njudiciary was supported upon grounds so destructive to the institutions\nof the country, and so entirely at war with the rights and liberties\nof the people, that the party could not secure entire unanimity in its\nsupport, three Democrats of the Senate and five of the House voting\nagainst the measure. They were unwilling to see the temples of justice\nand the seats of independent judges occupied by the tools of faction.\nThe declarations of the party leaders, the selection of party men for\njudges, and the total disregard for the public will in the adoption of\nthe measure, prove conclusively that the object has been not reform, but\ndestruction; not the advancement of the highest interests of the State,\nbut the predominance of party.\n\nWe cannot in this manner undertake to point out all the objections to\nthis party measure; we present you with those stated by the Council\nof Revision upon returning the bill, and we ask for them a candid\nconsideration.\n\nBelieving that the independence of the judiciary has been destroyed,\nthat hereafter our courts will be independent of the people, and\nentirely dependent upon the Legislature; that our rights of property\nand liberty of conscience can no longer be regarded as safe from the\nencroachments of unconstitutional legislation; and knowing of no other\nremedy which can be adopted consistently with the peace and good order\nof society, we call upon you to avail yourselves of the opportunity\nafforded, and, at the next general election, vote for a convention of\nthe people.\n\nS.

SPEED--MURDER CASE\n\nSPRINGFIELD June 19, 1841.\n\nDEAR SPEED:--We have had the highest state of excitement here for a week\npast that our community has ever witnessed; and, although the public\nfeeling is somewhat allayed, the curious affair which aroused it is very\nfar from being even yet cleared of mystery. It would take a quire of\npaper to give you anything like a full account of it, and I therefore\nonly propose a brief outline. The chief personages in the drama are\nArchibald Fisher, supposed to be murdered, and Archibald Trailor, Henry\nTrailor, and William Trailor, supposed to have murdered him. The three\nTrailors are brothers: the first, Arch., as you know, lives in town;\nthe second, Henry, in Clary's Grove; and the third, William, in Warren\nCounty; and Fisher, the supposed murdered, being without a family, had\nmade his home with William. On Saturday evening, being the 29th of May,\nFisher and William came to Henry's in a one-horse dearborn, and there\nstayed over Sunday; and on Monday all three came to Springfield (Henry\non horseback) and joined Archibald at Myers's, the Dutch carpenter.\nThat evening at supper Fisher was missing, and so next morning some\nineffectual search was made for him; and on Tuesday, at one o'clock\nP.M., William and Henry started home without him. In a day or two Henry\nand one or two of his Clary-Grove neighbors came back for him again, and\nadvertised his disappearance in the papers. The knowledge of the matter\nthus far had not been general, and here it dropped entirely, till about\nthe 10th instant, when Keys received a letter from the postmaster in\nWarren County, that William had arrived at home, and was telling a very\nmysterious and improbable story about the disappearance of Fisher, which\ninduced the community there to suppose he had been disposed of unfairly.\nKeys made this letter public, which immediately set the whole town and\nadjoining county agog. And so it has continued until yesterday. The mass\nof the people commenced a systematic search for the dead body, while\nWickersham was despatched to arrest Henry Trailor at the Grove, and Jim\nMaxcy to Warren to arrest William. On Monday last, Henry was brought in,\nand showed an evident inclination to insinuate that he knew Fisher to be\ndead, and that Arch. and William had killed him. He said he guessed the\nbody could be found in Spring Creek, between the Beardstown road and\nHickox's mill. Away the people swept like a herd of buffalo, and cut\ndown Hickox's mill-dam nolens volens, to draw the water out of the pond,\nand then went up and down and down and up the creek, fishing and raking,\nand raking and ducking and diving for two days, and, after all, no dead\nbody found."

        "content": "In the meantime a sort of scuffling-ground had been found in the brush\nin the angle, or point, where the road leading into the woods past\nthe brewery and the one leading in past the brick-yard meet. From the\nscuffle-ground was the sign of something about the size of a man having\nbeen dragged to the edge of the thicket, where it joined the track\nof some small-wheeled carriage drawn by one horse, as shown by the\nroad-tracks. The carriage-track led off toward Spring Creek. Near this\ndrag-trail Dr. Merryman found two hairs, which, after a long scientific\nexamination, he pronounced to be triangular human hairs, which term, he\nsays, includes within it the whiskers, the hair growing under the arms\nand on other parts of the body; and he judged that these two were of the\nwhiskers, because the ends were cut, showing that they had flourished in\nthe neighborhood of the razor's operations. On Thursday last Jim Maxcy\nbrought in William Trailor from Warren. On the same day Arch. was\narrested and put in jail. Yesterday (Friday) William was put upon his\nexamining trial before May and Lovely. Archibald and Henry were both\npresent. Lamborn prosecuted, and Logan, Baker, and your humble servant\ndefended. A great many witnesses were introduced and examined, but I\nshall only mention those whose testimony seemed most important. The\nfirst of these was Captain Ransdell. He swore that when William and\nHenry left Springfield for home on Tuesday before mentioned they did not\ntake the direct route,--which, you know, leads by the butcher shop,--but\nthat they followed the street north until they got opposite, or nearly\nopposite, May's new house, after which he could not see them from where\nhe stood; and it was afterwards proved that in about an hour after they\nstarted, they came into the street by the butcher shop from toward the\nbrickyard. Dr. Merryman and others swore to what is stated about the\nscuffle-ground, drag-trail, whiskers, and carriage tracks. Henry was\nthen introduced by the prosecution. He swore that when they started for\nhome they went out north, as Ransdell stated, and turned down west\nby the brick-yard into the woods, and there met Archibald; that they\nproceeded a small distance farther, when he was placed as a sentinel to\nwatch for and announce the approach of any one that might happen that\nway; that William and Arch. took the dearborn out of the road a small\ndistance to the edge of the thicket, where they stopped, and he saw\nthem lift the body of a man into it; that they then moved off with the\ncarriage in the direction of Hickox's mill, and he loitered about for\nsomething like an hour, when William returned with the carriage, but\nwithout Arch., and said they had put him in a safe place; that they went\nsomehow he did not know exactly how--into the road close to the brewery,\nand proceeded on to Clary's Grove. He also stated that some time during\nthe day William told him that he and Arch. had killed Fisher the evening\nbefore; that the way they did it was by him William knocking him down\nwith a club, and Arch. then choking him to death.\n\nAn old man from Warren, called Dr. Gilmore, was then introduced on\nthe part of the defense. He swore that he had known Fisher for several\nyears; that Fisher had resided at his house a long time at each of two\ndifferent spells--once while he built a barn for him, and once while\nhe was doctored for some chronic disease; that two or three years ago\nFisher had a serious hurt in his head by the bursting of a gun, since\nwhich he had been subject to continued bad health and occasional\naberration of mind. He also stated that on last Tuesday, being the same\nday that Maxcy arrested William Trailor, he (the doctor) was from home\nin the early part of the day, and on his return, about eleven o'clock,\nfound Fisher at his house in bed, and apparently very unwell; that he\nasked him how he came from Springfield; that Fisher said he had come by\nPeoria, and also told of several other places he had been at more in the\ndirection of Peoria, which showed that he at the time of speaking did\nnot know where he had been wandering about in a state of derangement.\nHe further stated that in about two hours he received a note from one of\nTrailor's friends, advising him of his arrest, and requesting him to go\non to Springfield as a witness, to testify as to the state of Fisher's\nhealth in former times; that he immediately set off, calling up two\nof his neighbors as company, and, riding all evening and all night,\novertook Maxcy and William at Lewiston in Fulton County; that Maxcy\nrefusing to discharge Trailor upon his statement, his two neighbors\nreturned and he came on to Springfield. Some question being made as to\nwhether the doctor's story was not a fabrication, several acquaintances\nof his (among whom was the same postmaster who wrote Keys, as before\nmentioned) were introduced as sort of compurgators, who swore that they\nknew the doctor to be of good character for truth and veracity, and\ngenerally of good character in every way.\n\nHere the testimony ended, and the Trailors were discharged, Arch. and\nWilliam expressing both in word and manner their entire confidence that\nFisher would be found alive at the doctor's by Galloway, Mallory, and\nMyers, who a day before had been despatched for that purpose; which\nHenry still protested that no power on earth could ever show Fisher\nalive. Thus stands this curious affair. When the doctor's story\nwas first made public, it was amusing to scan and contemplate the\ncountenances and hear the remarks of those who had been actively in\nsearch for the dead body: some looked quizzical, some melancholy, and\nsome furiously angry. Porter, who had been very active, swore he always\nknew the man was not dead, and that he had not stirred an inch to hunt\nfor him; Langford, who had taken the lead in cutting down Hickox's\nmill-dam, and wanted to hang Hickox for objecting, looked most\nawfully woebegone: he seemed the \"victim of unrequited affection,\" as\nrepresented in the comic almanacs we used to laugh over; and Hart, the\nlittle drayman that hauled Molly home once, said it was too damned bad\nto have so much trouble, and no hanging after all.\n\nI commenced this letter on yesterday, since which I received yours of\nthe 13th. I stick to my promise to come to Louisville. Nothing new here\nexcept what I have written. I have not seen ______ since my last trip,\nand I am going out there as soon as I mail this letter.\n\nYours forever, LINCOLN.\n\nSTATEMENT ABOUT HARRY WILTON.\n\nJune 25, 1841\n\nIt having been charged in some of the public prints that Harry Wilton,\nlate United States marshal for the district of Illinois, had used his\noffice for political effect, in the appointment of deputies for the\ntaking of the census for the year 1840, we, the undersigned, were called\nupon by Mr. Wilton to examine the papers in his possession relative\nto these appointments, and to ascertain therefrom the correctness or\nincorrectness of such charge. We accompanied Mr. Wilton to a room, and\nexamined the matter as fully as we could with the means afforded us. The\nonly sources of information bearing on the subject which were submitted\nto us were the letters, etc., recommending and opposing the various\nappointments made, and Mr. Wilton's verbal statements concerning the\nsame. From these letters, etc., it appears that in some instances\nappointments were made in accordance with the recommendations of leading\nWhigs, and in opposition to those of leading Democrats; among which\ninstances the appointments at Scott, Wayne, Madison, and Lawrence are\nthe strongest. According to Mr. Wilton's statement of the seventy-six\nappointments we examined, fifty-four were of Democrats, eleven of Whigs,\nand eleven of unknown politics."

        "content": "The chief ground of complaint against Mr. Wilton, as we had understood\nit, was because of his appointment of so many Democratic candidates for\nthe Legislature, thus giving them a decided advantage over their\nWhig opponents; and consequently our attention was directed rather\nparticularly to that point. We found that there were many such\nappointments, among which were those in Tazewell, McLean, Iroquois,\nColes, Menard, Wayne, Washington, Fayette, etc.; and we did not\nlearn that there was one instance in which a Whig candidate for the\nLegislature had been appointed. There was no written evidence before\nus showing us at what time those appointments were made; but Mr. Wilton\nstated that they all with one exception were made before those\nappointed became candidates for the Legislature, and the letters, etc.,\nrecommending them all bear date before, and most of them long before,\nthose appointed were publicly announced candidates.\n\nWe give the foregoing naked facts and draw no conclusions from them.\n\nBEND. S. EDWARDS, A. LINCOLN.\n\nTO MISS MARY SPEED--PRACTICAL SLAVERY\n\nBLOOMINGTON, ILL., September 27, 1841.\n\nMiss Mary Speed, Louisville, Ky.\n\nMY FRIEND: By the way, a fine example was presented on board the boat\nfor contemplating the effect of condition upon human happiness. A\ngentleman had purchased twelve negroes in different parts of Kentucky,\nand was taking them to a farm in the South. They were chained six and\nsix together. A small iron clevis was around the left wrist of each,\nand this fastened to the main chain by a shorter one, at a convenient\ndistance from the others, so that the negroes were strung together\nprecisely like so many fish upon a trotline. In this condition they\nwere being separated forever from the scenes of their childhood, their\nfriends, their fathers and mothers, and brothers and sisters, and many\nof them from their wives and children, and going into perpetual\nslavery where the lash of the master is proverbially more ruthless\nand unrelenting than any other; and yet amid all these distressing\ncircumstances, as we would think them, they were the most cheerful and\napparently happy creatures on board. One, whose offence for which he\nhad been sold was an overfondness for his wife, played the fiddle almost\ncontinually, and the others danced, sang, cracked jokes, and played\nvarious games with cards from day to day. How true it is that 'God\ntempers the wind to the shorn lamb,' or in other words, that he renders\nthe worst of human conditions tolerable, while he permits the best to\nbe nothing better than tolerable. To return to the narrative: When we\nreached Springfield I stayed but one day, when I started on this tedious\ncircuit where I now am. Do you remember my going to the city, while I\nwas in Kentucky, to have a tooth extracted, and making a failure of it?\nWell, that same old tooth got to paining me so much that about a week\nsince I had it torn out, bringing with it a bit of the jawbone, the\nconsequence of which is that my mouth is now so sore that I can neither\ntalk nor eat.\n\nYour sincere friend, A. LINCOLN.\n\n1842\n\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED--ON MARRIAGE\n\nJanuary 30, 1842.\n\nMY DEAR SPEED:--Feeling, as you know I do, the deepest solicitude for\nthe success of the enterprise you are engaged in, I adopt this as the\nlast method I can adopt to aid you, in case (which God forbid!) you\nshall need any aid. I do not place what I am going to say on paper\nbecause I can say it better that way than I could by word of mouth, but,\nwere I to say it orally before we part, most likely you would forget\nit at the very time when it might do you some good. As I think it\nreasonable that you will feel very badly some time between this and the\nfinal consummation of your purpose, it is intended that you shall read\nthis just at such a time. Why I say it is reasonable that you will feel\nvery badly yet, is because of three special causes added to the general\none which I shall mention.\n\nThe general cause is, that you are naturally of a nervous temperament;\nand this I say from what I have seen of you personally, and what you\nhave told me concerning your mother at various times, and concerning\nyour brother William at the time his wife died. The first special cause\nis your exposure to bad weather on your journey, which my experience\nclearly proves to be very severe on defective nerves. The second is the\nabsence of all business and conversation of friends, which might divert\nyour mind, give it occasional rest from the intensity of thought which\nwill sometimes wear the sweetest idea threadbare and turn it to the\nbitterness of death. The third is the rapid and near approach of that\ncrisis on which all your thoughts and feelings concentrate.\n\nIf from all these causes you shall escape and go through triumphantly,\nwithout another \"twinge of the soul,\" I shall be most happily but most\negregiously deceived. If, on the contrary, you shall, as I expect you\nwill at sometime, be agonized and distressed, let me, who have some\nreason to speak with judgment on such a subject, beseech you to ascribe\nit to the causes I have mentioned, and not to some false and ruinous\nsuggestion of the Devil.\n\n\"But,\" you will say, \"do not your causes apply to every one engaged in\na like undertaking?\" By no means. The particular causes, to a greater\nor less extent, perhaps do apply in all cases; but the general\none,--nervous debility, which is the key and conductor of all\nthe particular ones, and without which they would be utterly\nharmless,--though it does pertain to you, does not pertain to one in a\nthousand. It is out of this that the painful difference between you and\nthe mass of the world springs.\n\nI know what the painful point with you is at all times when you are\nunhappy; it is an apprehension that you do not love her as you should.\nWhat nonsense! How came you to court her? Was it because you thought she\ndeserved it, and that you had given her reason to expect it? If it was\nfor that why did not the same reason make you court Ann Todd, and at\nleast twenty others of whom you can think, and to whom it would apply\nwith greater force than to her? Did you court her for her wealth? Why,\nyou know she had none. But you say you reasoned yourself into it. What\ndo you mean by that? Was it not that you found yourself unable to reason\nyourself out of it? Did you not think, and partly form the purpose, of\ncourting her the first time you ever saw her or heard of her? What had\nreason to do with it at that early stage? There was nothing at that time\nfor reason to work upon. Whether she was moral, amiable, sensible,\nor even of good character, you did not, nor could then know, except,\nperhaps, you might infer the last from the company you found her in.\n\nAll you then did or could know of her was her personal appearance and\ndeportment; and these, if they impress at all, impress the heart, and\nnot the head.\n\nSay candidly, were not those heavenly black eyes the whole basis of all\nyour early reasoning on the subject? After you and I had once been at\nthe residence, did you not go and take me all the way to Lexington and\nback, for no other purpose but to get to see her again, on our return\non that evening to take a trip for that express object? What earthly\nconsideration would you take to find her scouting and despising you, and\ngiving herself up to another? But of this you have no apprehension; and\ntherefore you cannot bring it home to your feelings.\n\nI shall be so anxious about you that I shall want you to write by every\nmail.\n\nYour friend, LINCOLN.\n\nTO JOSHUA F. SPEED.\n\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, February 3, 1842."

Whitney for their courtesy in allowing them\nto publish \"Lincoln's Lost Speech.\"\n\nLINCOLN'S SPEECHES AND LETTERS\n\n_Lincoln's First Public Speech. From an Address to the People of\nSangamon County. March 9, 1832_\n\nUpon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any plan or\nsystem respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most\nimportant subject which we, as a people, can be engaged in. That every\nman may receive at least a moderate education, and thereby be enabled to\nread the histories of his own and other countries, by which he may duly\nappreciate the value of our free institutions, appears to be an object\nof vital importance, even on this account alone, to say nothing of the\nadvantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read\nthe Scriptures and other works, both of a religious and moral nature,\nfor themselves.\n\nFor my part, I desire to see the time when education--and by its means\nmorality, sobriety, enterprise, and industry--shall become much more\ngeneral than at present; and should be gratified to have it in my power\nto contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might\nhave a tendency to accelerate that happy period.\n\nWith regard to existing laws, some alterations are thought to be\nnecessary. Many respectable men have suggested that our estray laws--the\nlaw respecting the issuing of executions, the road law, and some\nothers--are deficient in their present form, and require alterations.\nBut considering the great probability that the framers of those laws\nwere wiser than myself, I should prefer not meddling with them, unless\nthey were first attacked by others, in which case I should feel it both\na privilege and a duty to take that stand which, in my view, might tend\nto the advancement of justice.\n\nBut, fellow-citizens, I shall conclude. Considering the great degree of\nmodesty which should always attend youth, it is probable I have already\nbeen more presuming than becomes me. However, upon the subjects of which\nI have treated, I have spoken as I have thought. I may be wrong in\nregard to any or all of them; but, holding it a sound maxim that it is\nbetter only to be sometimes right than at all times wrong, so soon as I\ndiscover my opinions to be erroneous I shall be ready to renounce them.\n\nEvery man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether it be true or\nnot, I can say, for one, that I have no other so great as that of being\ntruly esteemed of my fellow-men by rendering myself worthy of their\nesteem. How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be\ndeveloped. I am young and unknown to many of you; I was born and have\never remained in the most humble walks of life. I have no wealthy or\npopular relations or friends to recommend me. My case is thrown\nexclusively upon the independent voters of the county, and if elected,\nthey will have conferred a favour upon me for which I shall be\nunremitting in my labours to compensate. But if the good people in their\nwisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background, I have been too\nfamiliar with disappointments to be very much chagrined.\n\nYour friend and fellow-citizen,\nA. LINCOLN.\n\n_Letter to Colonel Robert Allen. June 21, 1836_\n\nDear Colonel, I am told that during my absence last week you passed\nthrough this place, and stated publicly that you were in possession of a\nfact or facts which, if known to the public, would entirely destroy the\nprospects of N.W. Edwards and myself at the ensuing election; but that,\nthrough favour to us, you should forbear to divulge them. No one has\nneeded favours more than I, and, generally, few have been less unwilling\nto accept them; but in this case favour to me would be injustice to the\npublic, and therefore I must beg your pardon for declining it. That I\nonce had the confidence of the people of Sangamon, is sufficiently\nevident; and if I have since done anything, either by design or\nmisadventure, which if known would subject me to a forfeiture of that\nconfidence, he that knows of that thing, and conceals it, is a traitor\nto his country's interest."

From a Letter published in the\nSangamon \"Journal.\" June 13, 1836_\n\nI go for all sharing the privileges of the government who assist in\nbearing its burdens: consequently I go for admitting all whites to the\nright of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms [by no means excluding\nfemales].\n\n_From an Address before the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois.\nJanuary 27, 1837_\n\nAs a subject for the remarks of the evening \"The perpetuation of our\npolitical institutions\" is selected. In the great journal of things\nhappening under the sun, we, the American people, find our account\nrunning under the date of the nineteenth century of the Christian era.\nWe find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of\nthe earth, as regards extent of territory, fertility of soil, and\nsalubrity of climate. We find ourselves under the government of a system\nof political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of\ncivil and religious liberty, than any of which the history of former\ntimes tells us. We, when remounting the stage of existence, found\nourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings. We toiled\nnot in the acquirement or the establishment of them; they are a legacy\nbequeathed to us by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic, but now lamented\nand departed race of ancestors.\n\nTheirs was the task (and nobly they performed it) to possess themselves,\nand through themselves us, of this goodly land, and to rear upon its\nhills and valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; 'tis\nours only to transmit these,--the former unprofaned by the foot of the\ninvader; the latter undecayed by lapse of time. This, our duty to\nourselves and to our posterity, and love for our species in general,\nimperatively require us to perform.\n\nHow, then, shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the\napproach of danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we\nexpect some transatlantic military giant to step across the ocean and\ncrush us at a blow? Never. All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa\ncombined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their\nmilitary chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not, by force,\ntake a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a\ntrial of a thousand years.\n\nAt what point, then, is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer,\nif it ever reaches us, it must spring up among us. It cannot come from\nabroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and\nfinisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die\nby suicide.\n\nThere is even now something of ill omen among us. I mean the increasing\ndisregard for law which pervades the country; the growing disposition to\nsubstitute wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of\ncourts; and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of\njustice. This disposition is awfully fearful in any community; and that\nit now exists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit, it would\nbe a violation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI know the American people are _much_ attached to their government. I\nknow they would suffer _much_ for its sake. I know they would endure\nevils long and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it\nfor another. Yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws be continually\ndespised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons\nand property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob, the\nalienation of their affection for the government is the natural\nconsequence, and to that sooner or later it must come.\n\nHere, then, is one point at which danger may be expected. The question\nrecurs, how shall we fortify against it? The answer is simple. Let every\nAmerican, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to his posterity,\nswear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate in the least\nparticular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate their\nviolation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support\nof the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the\nConstitution and the Laws let every American pledge his life, his\nproperty, and his sacred honour; let every man remember that to violate\nthe law is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the\ncharter of his own and his children's liberty. Let reverence for the\nlaws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that\nprattles on her lap. Let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in\ncolleges. Let it be written in primers, spelling-books, and in almanacs.\nLet it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and\nenforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it become the\npolitical religion of the nation.\n\nWhen I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me\nnot be understood as saying that there are no bad laws, or that\ngrievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions\nhave been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do mean to say that\nalthough bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as\npossible, still, while they continue in force, for the sake of example\nthey should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided cases. If\nsuch arise, let proper legal provisions be made for them with the least\npossible delay, but till then let them, if not too intolerable, be borne\nwith.\n\nThere is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law. In any\ncase that may arise, as, for instance, the promulgation of abolitionism,\none of two positions is necessarily true--that is, the thing is right\nwithin itself, and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all\ngood citizens, or it is wrong, and therefore proper to be prohibited by\nlegal enactments; and in neither case is the interposition of mob law\neither necessary, justifiable, or excusable....\n\nThey (histories of the Revolution) were pillars of the temple of\nliberty; and now that they have crumbled away, that temple must fall\nunless we, their descendants, supply their places with other pillars,\nhewn from the solid quarry of sober reason. Passion has helped us, but\ncan do so no more. It will in future be our enemy. Reason--cold,\ncalculating, unimpassioned reason--must furnish all the materials for\nour future support and defence. Let those materials be moulded into\ngeneral intelligence, sound morality, and, in particular, a reverence\nfor the Constitution and laws; and that we improved to the last, that we\nremained free to the last, that we revered his name to the last, that\nduring his long sleep we permitted no hostile foot to pass over or\ndesecrate his resting-place, shall be that which to learn the last trump\nshall awaken our Washington.\n\nUpon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest, as the rock of its\nbasis; and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution,\n\"the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\""

At\nthe close of that struggle, nearly every adult male had been a\nparticipator in some of its scenes. The consequence was, that of those\nscenes, in the form of a husband, a father, a son, or a brother, a\nliving history was to be found in every family,--a history bearing the\nindubitable testimonies to its own authenticity in the limbs mangled, in\nthe scars of wounds received in the midst of the very scenes related; a\nhistory, too, that could be read and understood alike by all, the wise\nand the ignorant, the learned and the unlearned.

Browning. Springfield, Illinois. April 1, 1838_\n\nDear Madam, Without apologising for being egotistical, I shall make the\nhistory of so much of my life as has elapsed since I saw you the subject\nof this letter. And, by the way, I now discover that in order to give a\nfull and intelligible account of the things I have done and suffered\nsince I saw you, I shall necessarily have to relate some that happened\nbefore.\n\nIt was, then, in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of my\nacquaintance, and who was a great friend of mine, being about to pay a\nvisit to her father and other relatives residing in Kentucky, proposed\nto me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on\ncondition that I would engage to become her brother-in-law with all\nconvenient dispatch. I, of course, accepted the proposal, for you know I\ncould not have done otherwise had I really been averse to it; but\nprivately, between you and me, I was most confoundedly well pleased with\nthe project. I had seen the said sister some three years before, thought\nher intelligent and agreeable, and saw no good objection to plodding\nlife through hand-in-hand with her. Time passed on, the lady took her\njourney, and in due time returned, sister in company, sure enough. This\nastonished me a little, for it appeared to me that her coming so readily\nshowed that she was a trifle too willing, but on reflection it occurred\nto me that she might have been prevailed on by her married sister to\ncome, without anything concerning me having been mentioned to her, and\nso I concluded that if no other objection presented itself, I would\nconsent to waive this. All this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival\nin the neighbourhood--for, be it remembered, I had not yet seen her,\nexcept about three years previous, as above mentioned. In a few days we\nhad an interview, and, although I had seen her before, she did not look\nas my imagination had pictured her. I knew she was over-size, but she\nnow appeared a fair match for Falstaff. I knew she was called an \"old\nmaid,\" and I felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the\nappellation, but now, when I beheld her, I could not for my life avoid\nthinking of my mother; and this, not from withered features,--for her\nskin was too full of fat to permit of its contracting into wrinkles--but\nfrom her want of teeth, weather-beaten appearance in general, and from a\nkind of notion that ran in my head that nothing could have commenced at\nthe size of infancy and reached her present bulk in less than\nthirty-five or forty years; and, in short, I was not at all pleased with\nher. But what could I do? I had told her sister that I would take her\nfor better or for worse, and I made a point of honour and conscience in\nall things to stick to my word, especially if others had been induced to\nact on it, which in this case I had no doubt they had, for I was now\nfairly convinced that no other man on earth would have her, and hence\nthe conclusion that they were bent on holding me to my bargain. \"Well,\"\nthought I, \"I have said it, and, be the consequences what they may, it\nshall not be my fault if I fail to do it.\" At once I determined to\nconsider her my wife, and this done, all my powers of discovery were put\nto work in search of perfections in her which might be fairly set off\nagainst her defects. I tried to imagine her handsome, which, but for her\nunfortunate corpulency, was actually true. Exclusive of this, no woman\nthat I have ever seen has a finer face. I also tried to convince myself\nthat the mind was much more to be valued than the person, and in this\nshe was not inferior, as I could discover, to any with whom I had been\nacquainted.\n\nShortly after this, without attempting to come to any positive\nunderstanding with her, I set out for Vandalia, when and where you first\nsaw me. During my stay there I had letters from her which did not change\nmy opinion of either her intellect or intention, but, on the contrary,\nconfirmed it in both.\n\nAll this while, although I was fixed \"firm as the surge-repelling rock\"\nin my resolution, I found I was continually repenting the rashness which\nhad led me to make it. Through life I have been in no bondage, either\nreal or imaginary, from the thraldom of which I so much desired to be\nfree. After my return home I saw nothing to change my opinion of her in\nany particular. She was the same, and so was I. I now spent my time in\nplanning how I might get along in life after my contemplated change of\ncircumstances should have taken place, and how I might procrastinate the\nevil day for a time, which I really dreaded as much, perhaps more, than\nan Irishman does the halter."

        "content": "After all my sufferings upon this deeply interesting subject, here I\nam, wholly, unexpectedly, completely out of the \"scrape,\" and I now want\nto know if you can guess how I got out of it--out, clear, in every sense\nof the term--no violation of word, honour, or conscience. I don't\nbelieve you can guess, and so I might as well tell you at once. As the\nlawyer says, it was done in the manner following, to wit: After I had\ndelayed the matter as long as I thought I could in honour do (which, by\nthe way, had brought me round into the last fall), I concluded I might\nas well bring it to a consummation without further delay, and so I\nmustered my resolution and made the proposal to her direct; but,\nshocking to relate, she answered, No. At first I supposed she did it\nthrough an affectation of modesty, which I thought but ill became her\nunder the peculiar circumstances of the case, but on my renewal of the\ncharge I found she repelled it with greater firmness than before. I\ntried it again and again, but with the same success, or rather with the\nsame want of success.\n\nI finally was forced to give it up, at which I very unexpectedly found\nmyself mortified almost beyond endurance. I was mortified, it seemed to\nme, in a hundred different ways. My vanity was deeply wounded by the\nreflection that I had so long been too stupid to discover her\nintentions, and at the same time never doubting that I understood them\nperfectly; and also that she, whom I had taught myself to believe nobody\nelse would have, had actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness.\nAnd, to cap the whole, I then for the first time began to suspect that I\nwas really a little in love with her. But let it all go! I'll try and\noutlive it. Others have been made fools of by the girls, but this can\nnever in truth be said of me. I most emphatically, in this instance,\nmade a fool of myself. I have now come to the conclusion never again to\nthink of marrying, and for this reason--I can never be satisfied with\nany one who would be blockhead enough to have me.\n\nWhen you receive this, write me a long yarn about something to amuse me.\nGive my respects to Mr. Browning.\n\n_From a Debate between Lincoln, E.D. Baker, and others against Douglas,\nLamborn, and others. Springfield. December 1839_\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n... Mr. Lamborn insists that the difference between the Van Buren party\nand the Whigs is, that although the former sometimes err in practice,\nthey are always correct in principle, whereas the latter are wrong in\nprinciple; and the better to impress this proposition, he uses a\nfigurative expression in these words: \"The Democrats are vulnerable in\nthe heel, but they are sound in the heart and in the head.\" The first\nbranch of the figure--that is, that the Democrats are vulnerable in the\nheel--I admit is not merely figuratively but literally true. Who that\nlooks but for a moment at their Swartwouts, their Prices, their\nHarringtons, and their hundreds of others, scampering away with the\npublic money to Texas, to Europe, and to every spot of the earth where a\nvillain may hope to find refuge from justice, can at all doubt that they\nare most distressingly affected in their heels with a species of running\nfever? It seems that this malady of their heels operates on the\nsound-headed and honest-hearted creatures very much like the cork leg in\nthe song did on its owner, which, when he had once got started on it,\nthe more he tried to stop it, the more it would run away. At the hazard\nof wearing this point threadbare, I will relate an anecdote which seems\nto be too strikingly in point to be omitted. A witty Irish soldier who\nwas always boasting of his bravery when no danger was near, but who\ninvariably retreated without orders at the first charge of the\nengagement, being asked by his captain why he did so, replied, \"Captain,\nI have as brave a heart as Julius Cæsar ever had; but somehow or other,\nwhenever danger approaches, my cowardly legs will run away with it.\" So\nit is with Mr. Lamborn's party. They take the public money into their\nhands for the most laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts\ncan dictate, but before they can possibly get it out again, their\nrascally vulnerable heels will run away with them....\n\n_Letter to W.G. Anderson. Lawrenceville, Illinois. October 31, 1840_\n\nDear Sir, Your note of yesterday is received. In the difficulty between\nus of which you speak, you say you think I was the aggressor. I do not\nthink I was. You say my \"words imported insult.\" I meant them as a fair\nset-off to your own statements, and not otherwise; and in that light\nalone I now wish you to understand them. You ask for my present\n\"feelings on the subject.\" I entertain no unkind feelings to you, and\nnone of any sort upon the subject, except a sincere regret that I\npermitted myself to get into such an altercation.\n\n_Extract from a Letter to John T. Stuart. Springfield Illinois. January\n23, 1841_\n\nFor not giving you a general summary of news, you must pardon me; it is\nnot in my power to do so. I am now the most miserable man living. If\nwhat I feel were equally distributed to the whole human family, there\nwould not be one cheerful face on earth. Whether I shall ever be better,\nI cannot tell; I awfully forebode I shall not. To remain as I am is\nimpossible; I must die or be better, it appears to me. The matter you\nspeak of on my account you may attend to as you say, unless you shall\nhear of my condition forbidding it. I say this because I fear I shall be\nunable to attend to any business here, and a change of scene might help\nme. If I could be myself, I would rather remain at home with Judge\nLogan. I can write no more.\n\n_From an Address before the Washingtonian Temperance Society.\nSpringfield, Illinois. February 22, 1842_\n\nAlthough the temperance cause has been in progress for nearly twenty\nyears, it is apparent to all that it is just now being crowned with a\ndegree of success hitherto unparalleled.\n\nThe list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties, of\nhundreds, and of thousands. The cause itself seems suddenly transformed\nfrom a cold abstract theory to a living, breathing, active and powerful\nchieftain, going forth conquering and to conquer. The citadels of his\ngreat adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled; his temples and\nhis altars, where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been\nperformed, and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made,\nare daily desecrated and deserted. The trump of the conqueror's fame is\nsounding from hill to hill, from sea to sea, and from land to land, and\ncalling millions to his standard at a blast.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But,\" say some, \"we are no drunkards, and we shall not acknowledge\nourselves such by joining a reform drunkard's society, whatever our\ninfluence might be.\" Surely no Christian will adhere to this objection."

        "content": "If they believe, as they profess, that Omnipotence condescended to take\non himself the form of sinful man, and, as such, to die an ignominious\ndeath for their sakes, surely they will not refuse submission to the\ninfinitely lesser condescension for the temporal and perhaps eternal\nsalvation of a large, erring, and unfortunate class of their\nfellow-creatures; nor is the condescension very great. In my judgment,\nsuch of us as have never fallen victims have been spared more from the\nabsence of appetite, than from any mental or moral superiority over\nthose who have. Indeed I believe, if we take habitual drunkards as a\nclass, their heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison\nwith those of any other class. There seems ever to have been a proneness\nin the brilliant and warm-blooded to fall into this vice. The demon of\nintemperance ever seems to have delighted in sucking the blood of genius\nand generosity. What one of us but can call to mind some relative more\npromising in youth than all his fellows, who has fallen a sacrifice to\nhis rapacity? He ever seems to have gone forth like the Egyptian angel\nof death, commissioned to slay, if not the first, the fairest born of\nevery family. Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career? In that\narrest all can give aid that will; and who shall be excused that can and\nwill not? Far around as human breath has ever blown, he keeps our\nfathers, our brothers, our sons, and our friends prostrate in the chains\nof moral death....\n\nWhen the conduct of men is designed to be influenced, persuasion, kind,\nunassuming persuasion, should ever be adopted. It is an old and a true\nmaxim \"that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.\"\nSo with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him\nthat you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches\nhis heart, which, say what you will, is the great high-road to his\nreason, and which, when once gained, you will find but little trouble in\nconvincing his judgment of the justice of your cause, if indeed that\ncause really be a just one. On the contrary, assume to dictate to his\njudgment, or to command his action, or to mark him as one to be shunned\nand despised, and he will retreat within himself, close all the avenues\nto his head and his heart; and though your cause be naked truth itself,\ntransformed to the heaviest lance, harder than steel, and sharper than\nsteel can be made, and though you throw it with more than herculean\nforce and precision, you shall be no more able to pierce him than to\npenetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw. Such is man,\nand so must he be understood by those who would lead him, even to his\nown best interests....\n\nAnother error, as it seems to me, into which the old reformers fell, was\nthe position that all habitual drunkards were utterly incorrigible, and\ntherefore must be turned adrift and damned without remedy in order that\nthe grace of temperance might abound, to the temperate then, and to all\nmankind some hundreds of years thereafter. There is in this something so\nrepugnant to humanity, so uncharitable, so cold-blooded and feelingless,\nthat it never did, nor never can enlist the enthusiasm of a popular\ncause. We could not love the man who taught it--we could not hear him\nwith patience. The heart could not throw open its portals to it, the\ngenerous man could not adopt it--it could not mix with his blood. It\nlooked so fiendishly selfish, so like throwing fathers and brothers\noverboard to lighten the boat for our security, that the noble-minded\nshrank from the manifest meanness of the thing. And besides this, the\nbenefits of a reformation to be effected by such a system were too\nremote in point of time to warmly engage many in its behalf. Few can be\ninduced to labour exclusively for posterity; and none will do it\nenthusiastically. Posterity has done nothing for us; and theorize on it\nas we may, practically we shall do very little for it, unless we are\nmade to think we are at the same time doing something for ourselves.\n\nWhat an ignorance of human nature does it exhibit, to ask or expect a\nwhole community to rise up and labour for the temporal happiness of\nothers, after themselves shall be consigned to the dust, a majority of\nwhich community take no pains whatever to secure their own eternal\nwelfare at no more distant day! Great distance in either time or space\nhas wonderful power to lull and render quiescent the human mind.\nPleasures to be enjoyed, or pains to be endured, after we shall be dead\nand gone, are but little regarded even in our own cases, and much less\nin the cases of others. Still, in addition to this there is something so\nludicrous in promises of good or threats of evil a great way off as to\nrender the whole subject with which they are connected easily turned\ninto ridicule. \"Better lay down that spade you are stealing, Paddy; if\nyou don't you'll pay for it at the day of judgment.\" \"Be the powers, if\nye'll credit me so long I'll take another jist.\"\n\n_From the Circular of the Whig Committee. An Address to the People of\nIllinois. March 4, 1843_\n\n... The system of loans is but temporary in its nature, and must soon\nexplode. It is a system not only ruinous while it lasts, but one that\nmust soon fail and leave us destitute.\n\nAs an individual who undertakes to live by borrowing soon finds his\noriginal means devoured by interest, and next, no one left to borrow\nfrom, so must it be with a government.\n\nWe repeat, then, that a tariff sufficient for revenue, or a direct tax,\nmust soon be resorted to; and, indeed, we believe this alternative is\nnow denied by no one. But which system shall be adopted? Some of our\nopponents in theory admit the propriety of a tariff sufficient for\nrevenue, but even they will not in practice vote for such a tariff;\nwhile others boldly advocate direct taxation. Inasmuch, therefore, as\nsome of them boldly advocate direct taxation, and all the rest--or so\nnearly all as to make exceptions needless--refuse to adopt the tariff,\nwe think it is doing them no injustice to class them all as advocates of\ndirect taxation. Indeed, we believe they are only delaying an open\navowal of the system till they can assure themselves that the people\nwill tolerate it. Let us, then, briefly compare the two systems. The\ntariff is the cheaper system, because the duties, being collected in\nlarge parcels, at a few commercial points, will require comparatively\nfew officers in their collection; while by the direct tax system the\nland must be literally covered with assessors and collectors, going\nforth like swarms of Egyptian locusts, devouring every blade of grass\nand other green thing. And, again, by the tariff system the whole\nrevenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods, and those chiefly the\nluxuries and not the necessaries of life. By this system, the man who\ncontents himself to live upon the products of his own country pays\nnothing at all. And surely that country is extensive enough, and its\nproducts abundant and varied enough, to answer all the real wants of its\npeople. In short, by this system the burden of revenue falls almost\nentirely on the wealthy and luxurious few, while the substantial and\nlabouring many, who live at home and upon home products, go entirely\nfree. By the direct tax system, none can escape. However strictly the\ncitizen may exclude from his premises all foreign luxuries, fine cloths,\nfine silks, rich wines, golden chains, and diamond rings,--still, for\nthe possession of his house, his barn, and his homespun he is to be\nperpetually haunted and harassed by the tax-gatherer. With these views,\nwe leave it to be determined whether we or our opponents are more truly\ndemocratic on the subject.\n\n_From a Letter to Martin M. Morris. Springfield, Illinois. March 26,\n1843_"

My\nwife has some relations in the Presbyterian churches, and some with the\nEpiscopal churches; and therefore, wherever it would tell, I was set\ndown as either the one or the other, while it was everywhere contended\nthat no Christian ought to go for me, because I belonged to no church,\nwas suspected of being a deist, and had talked about fighting a duel.\nWith all these things, Baker, of course, had nothing to do. Nor do I\ncomplain of them. As to his own church going for him, I think that was\nright enough, and as to the influences I have spoken of in the other,\nthough they were very strong, it would be grossly untrue and unjust to\ncharge that they acted upon them in a body, or were very near so. I only\nmean that those influences levied a tax of a considerable per cent. upon\nmy strength throughout the religious controversy. But enough of this.\n\n_From a Letter to Joshua F. Speed. Springfield. October 22, 1846_\n\nWe have another boy, born the 10th of March. He is very much such a\nchild as Bob was at his age, rather of a longer order. Bob is \"short and\nlow,\" and I expect always will be. He talks very plainly--almost as\nplainly as anybody. He is quite smart enough. I sometimes fear that he\nis one of the little rare-ripe sort that are smarter at about five than\never after. He has a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the\noffspring of such animal spirits. Since I began this letter, a messenger\ncame to tell me Bob was lost; but by the time I reached the house his\nmother had found him and had him whipped, and by now, very likely, he is\nrun away again.\n\n_From a Letter to William H. Herndon. Washington. January 8, 1848_\n\nDear William, Your letter of December 27th was received a day or two\nago. I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken, and\npromise to take in my little business there. As to speech-making, by way\nof getting the hang of the House, I made a little speech two or three\ndays ago on a post-office question of no general interest. I find\nspeaking here and elsewhere about the same thing. I was about as badly\nscared, and no worse, as I am when I speak in court. I expect to make\none within a week or two, in which I hope to succeed well enough to wish\nyou to see it.\n\nIt is very pleasant to learn from you that there are some who desire\nthat I should be re-elected. I most heartily thank them for their\npartiality; and I can say, as Mr. Clay said of the annexation of Texas,\nthat \"personally I would not object\" to a re-election, although I\nthought at the time, and still think, it would be quite as well for me\nto return to the law at the end of a single term. I made the declaration\nthat I would not be a candidate again, more from a wish to deal fairly\nwith others, to keep peace among our friends, and to keep the district\nfrom going to the enemy, than for any cause personal to myself; so that,\nif it should so happen that nobody else wishes to be elected, I could\nrefuse the people the right of sending me again. But to enter myself as\na competitor of others, or to authorize any one so to enter me, is what\nmy word and honour forbid.\n\n_From a Letter to William H. Herndon. Washington. June 22, 1848_\n\nAs to the young men. You must not wait to be brought forward by the\nolder men. For instance, do you suppose that I should ever have got into\nnotice if I had waited to be hunted up and pushed forward by older men?\nYou young men get together and form a \"Rough and Ready Club,\" and have\nregular meetings and speeches. Take in everybody you can get. Harrison\nGrimsley, L.A. Enos, Lee Kimball and C.W. Matheny will do to begin the\nthing; but as you go along gather up all the shrewd, wild boys about\ntown, whether just of age or a little under age--Chris. Logan, Reddick\nRidgley, Lewis Zwizler, and hundreds such. Let every one play the part\nhe can play best,--some speak, some sing, and all \"holler.\" Your\nmeetings will be of evenings; the older men, and the women, will go to\nhear you; so that it will not only contribute to the election of \"Old\nZach,\" but will be an interesting pastime, and improving to the\nintellectual faculties of all engaged. Don't fail to do this.\n\n_From a Letter to William H. Herndon. Washington, July 10, 1848_\n\nThe way for a young man to rise is to improve himself every way he can,\nnever suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder him. Allow me to assure\nyou that suspicion and jealousy never did help any man in any situation.\nThere may sometimes be ungenerous attempts to keep a young man down; and\nthey will succeed, too, if he allows his mind to be diverted from its\ntrue channel to brood over the attempted injury. Cast about, and see if\nthis feeling has not injured every person you have ever known to fall\ninto it.\n\n_Letter to John D. Johnston. January 2, 1851_\n\nDear Johnston, Your request for eighty dollars I do not think it best to\ncomply with now. At the various times when I have helped you a little\nyou have said to me, \"We can get along very well now\"; but in a very\nshort time I find you in the same difficulty again. Now, this can only\nhappen by some defect in your conduct. What that defect is, I think I\nknow. You are not lazy, and still you are an idler. I doubt whether,\nsince I saw you, you have done a good whole day's work in any one day.\nYou do not very much dislike to work, and still you do not work much,\nmerely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it.\nThis habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty; it is\nvastly important to you, and still more so to your children, that you\nshould break the habit. It is more important to them, because they have\nlonger to live, and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it,\neasier than they can get out after they are in."

November 4, 1851_\n\nDear Brother, When I came into Charleston day before yesterday, I\nlearned that you are anxious to sell the land where you live and move to\nMissouri. I have been thinking of this ever since, and cannot but think\nsuch a notion is utterly foolish. What can you do in Missouri better\nthan here? Is the land any richer? Can you there, any more than here,\nraise corn and wheat and oats without work? Will anybody there, any more\nthan here, do your work for you? If you intend to go to work, there is\nno better place than right where you are; if you do not intend to go to\nwork, you cannot get along anywhere. Squirming and crawling about from\nplace to place can do no good. You have raised no crop this year; and\nwhat you really want is to sell the land, get the money, and spend it.\nPart with the land you have, and, my life upon it, you will never after\nown a spot big enough to bury you in. Half you will get for the land you\nwill spend in moving to Missouri, and the other half you will eat,\ndrink, and wear out, and no foot of land will be bought. Now, I feel it\nmy duty to have no hand in such a piece of foolery. I feel that it is so\neven on your own account, and particularly on mother's account. The\neastern forty acres I intend to keep for mother while she lives; if you\nwill not cultivate it, it will rent for enough to support her--at least,\nit will rent for something. Her dower in the other two forties she can\nlet you have, and no thanks to me. Now, do not misunderstand this\nletter; I do not write it in any unkindness. I write it in order, if\npossible, to get you to face the truth, which truth is, you are\ndestitute because you have idled away all your time. Your thousand\npretences for not getting along better are all nonsense; they deceive\nnobody but yourself. Go to work is the only cure for your case.\n\nA word to mother. Chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him.\nIf I were you I would try it awhile. If you get tired of it (as I think\nyou will not), you can return to your own home. Chapman feels very\nkindly to you, and I have no doubt he will make your situation very\npleasant.\n\n_Note for Law Lecture. Written about July 1, 1850_\n\nI am not an accomplished lawyer. I find quite as much material for a\nlecture in those points wherein I have failed, as in those wherein I\nhave been moderately successful. The leading rule for a lawyer, as for\nthe man of every other calling, is diligence. Leave nothing for\nto-morrow which can be done to-day. Never let your correspondence fall\nbehind. Whatever piece of business you have in hand, before stopping, do\nall the labour pertaining to it which can then be done. When you bring a\ncommon law-suit, if you have the facts for doing so, write the\ndeclaration at once. If a law point be involved, examine the books, and\nnote the authority you rely on upon the declaration itself, where you\nare sure to find it when wanted. The same of defences and pleas. In\nbusiness not likely to be litigated,--ordinary collection cases,\nforeclosures, partitions, and the like,--make all examinations of\ntitles, and note them and even draft orders and decrees in advance. The\ncourse has a triple advantage; it avoids omissions and neglect, saves\nyour labour when once done, performs the labour out of court when you\nhave leisure, rather than in court when you have not.\n\nExtemporaneous speaking should be practised and cultivated. It is the\nlawyer's avenue to the public. However able and faithful he may be in\nother respects, people are slow to bring him business if he cannot make\na speech. And yet there is not a more fatal error to young lawyers than\nrelying too much on speech-making. If any one, upon his rare powers of\nspeaking, shall claim an exemption from the drudgery of the law, his\ncase is a failure in advance.\n\nDiscourage litigation. Persuade your neighbours to compromise whenever\nyou can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real\nloser--in fees, expenses, and waste of time. As a peace-maker the lawyer\nhas a superior opportunity of being a good man. There will still be\nbusiness enough.\n\nNever stir up litigation. A worse man can scarcely be found than one who\ndoes this. Who can be more nearly a fiend than he who habitually\noverhauls the register of deeds in search of defects in titles, whereon\nto stir up strife, and put money in his pocket? A moral tone ought to be\ninfused into the profession which should drive such men out of it.\n\nThe matter of fees is important, far beyond the mere question of bread\nand butter involved. Properly attended to, fuller justice is done to\nboth lawyer and client. An exorbitant fee should never be claimed. As a\ngeneral rule, never take your whole fee in advance, nor any more than a\nsmall retainer. When fully paid beforehand, you are more than a common\nmortal if you can feel the same interest in the case as if something was\nstill in prospect for you, as well as for your client. And when you lack\ninterest in the case the job will very likely lack skill and diligence\nin the performance. Settle the amount of fee and take a note in advance.\nThen you will feel that you are working for something, and you are sure\nto do your work faithfully and well. Never sell a fee-note--at least not\nbefore the consideration service is performed. It leads to negligence\nand dishonesty--negligence by losing interest in the case, and\ndishonesty in refusing to refund when you have allowed the consideration\nto fail.\n\nThere is a vague popular belief that lawyers are necessarily dishonest.\nI say vague, because when we consider to what extent confidence and\nhonours are reposed in and conferred upon lawyers by the people, it\nappears improbable that their impression of dishonesty is very distinct\nand vivid. Yet the impression is common, almost universal. Let no young\nman choosing the law for a calling for a moment yield to the popular\nbelief. Resolve to be honest at all events; and if in your own judgment\nyou cannot be an honest lawyer, resolve to be honest without being a\nlawyer. Choose some other occupation, rather than one in the choosing of\nwhich you do, in advance, consent to be a knave."

        "content": "_A Fragment. Written about July 1, 1854_\n\nEquality in society alike beats inequality, whether the latter be of the\nBritish aristocratic sort or of the domestic slavery sort.\n\nWe know Southern men declare that their slaves are better off than hired\nlabourers amongst us. How little they know whereof they speak! There is\nno permanent class of hired labourers amongst us. Twenty-five years ago\nI was a hired labourer. The hired labourer of yesterday labours on his\nown account to-day, and will hire others to labour for him to-morrow.\n\nAdvancement--improvement in condition--is the order of things in a\nsociety of equals. As labour is the common burden of our race, so the\neffort of some to shift their share of the burden on to the shoulders of\nothers is the great durable curse of the race. Originally a curse for\ntransgression upon the whole race, when, as by slavery, it is\nconcentrated on a part only, it becomes the double-refined curse of God\nupon his creatures.\n\nFree labour has the inspiration of hope; pure slavery has no hope. The\npower of hope upon human exertion and happiness is wonderful. The\nslave-master himself has a conception of it, and hence the system of\ntasks among slaves. The slave whom you cannot drive with the lash to\nbreak seventy-five pounds of hemp in a day, if you will task him to\nbreak a hundred, and promise him pay for all he does over, he will break\nyou a hundred and fifty. You have substituted hope for the rod.\n\nAnd yet perhaps it does not occur to you that, to the extent of your\ngain in the case, you have given up the slave system and adopted the\nfree system of labour.\n\n_A Fragment on Slavery. July 1854_\n\nIf A can prove, however conclusively, that he may of right enslave B,\nwhy may not B snatch the same argument and prove equally that he may\nenslave A? You say A is white and B is black. It is colour, then; the\nlighter having the right to enslave the darker? Take care. By this rule\nyou are to be slave to the first man you meet with a fairer skin than\nyour own.\n\nYou do not mean colour exactly? You mean the whites are intellectually\nthe superiors of the blacks, and therefore have the right to enslave\nthem? Take care again. By this rule you are to be slave to the first man\nyou meet with an intellect superior to your own.\n\nBut, say you, it is a question of interest, and if you make it your\ninterest you have the right to enslave another. Very well. And if he can\nmake it his interest he has the right to enslave you.\n\n_Lincoln's Reply to Senator Douglas at Peoria, Illinois. The Origin of\nthe Wilmot Proviso. October 16, 1854_\n\n... Our war with Mexico broke out in 1846. When Congress was about\nadjourning that session, President Polk asked them to place two millions\nof dollars under his control, to be used by him in the recess, if found\npracticable and expedient, in negotiating a treaty of peace with Mexico,\nand acquiring some part of her territory. A bill was duly gotten up for\nthe purpose, and was progressing swimmingly in the House of\nRepresentatives, when a Democratic member from Pennsylvania by the name\nof David Wilmot moved as an amendment, \"Provided, that in any territory\nthus acquired there shall never be slavery.\" _This is the origin of the\nfar-famed Wilmot Proviso._ It created a great flutter; but it stuck like\nwax, was voted into the bill, and the bill passed with it through the\nHouse. The Senate, however, adjourned without final action on it, and so\nboth the appropriation and the proviso were lost for the time.\n\n... This declared indifference, but, as I must think, real, covert zeal,\nfor the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the\nmonstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our\nrepublican example of its just influence in the world, enables the\nenemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as\nhypocrites, causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity,\nand especially because it forces so many good men amongst ourselves into\nan open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty,\ncriticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is\nno right principle of action but self-interest.\n\nBefore proceeding let me say that I think I have no prejudice against\nthe Southern people. They are just what we would be in their situation.\nIf slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If\nit did now exist among us, we should not instantly give it up. This I\nbelieve of the masses North and South. Doubtless there are individuals\non both sides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances, and\nothers who would gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of\nexistence. We know that some Southern men do free their slaves, go North\nand become tip-top Abolitionists, while some Northern ones go South and\nbecome most cruel slave-masters.\n\nWhen Southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin\nof slavery than we are, I acknowledge the fact. When it is said that the\ninstitution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of it in\nany satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I\nsurely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to\ndo myself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to\ndo as to the existing institution. My first impulse would be to free all\nthe slaves, and send them to Liberia, to their own native land. But a\nmoment's reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope (as I\nthink there is) there may be in this in the long run, its sudden\nexecution is impossible. If they were all landed there in a day, they\nwould all perish in the next ten days; and there are not surplus\nshipping and surplus money enough to carry them there in many times ten\ndays. What then? Free them all, and keep them among us as underlings? Is\nit quite certain that this betters their condition? I think I would not\nhold one in slavery at any rate, yet the point is not clear enough for\nme to denounce people upon. What next? Free them, and make them\npolitically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of\nthis, and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of\nwhites will not. Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound\njudgment is not the sole question, if indeed it is any part of it. A\nuniversal feeling, whether well or ill founded, cannot be safely\ndisregarded. We cannot then make them equals. It does seem to me that\nsystems of gradual emancipation might be adopted, but for their\ntardiness in this I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the\nSouth.\n\nEqual justice to the South, it is said, requires us to consent to the\nextension of slavery to new countries. That is to say, that inasmuch as\nyou do not object to my taking my hog to Nebraska, therefore I must not\nobject to your taking your slave. Now, I admit that this is perfectly\nlogical, if there is no difference between hogs and slaves. But while\nyou thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro, I wish to ask\nwhether you of the South, yourselves, have ever been willing to do as\nmuch? It is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world,\nonly a small percentage are natural tyrants. That percentage is no\nlarger in the slave States than in the free. The great majority, South\nas well as North, have human sympathies, of which they can no more\ndivest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain.\nThese sympathies in the bosoms of the Southern people manifest in many\nways their sense of the wrong of slavery, and their consciousness that,\nafter all, there is humanity in the negro. If they deny this let me\naddress them a few plain questions."

        "content": "In 1820 you joined the North almost unanimously in declaring the African\nslave-trade piracy, and in annexing to it the punishment of death. Why\ndid you do this? If you did not feel that it was wrong, why did you join\nin providing that men should be hung for it? The practice was no more\nthan bringing wild negroes from Africa to such as would buy them. But\nyou never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horses,\nwild buffaloes, or wild bears.\n\nAgain, you have among you a sneaking individual of the class of native\ntyrants known as the _slave-dealer_. He watches your necessities, and\ncrawls up to buy your slave at a speculating price. If you cannot help\nit, you sell to him; but if you can help it, you drive him from your\ndoor. You despise him utterly; you do not recognize him as a friend, or\neven as an honest man. Your children must not play with his; they may\nrollick freely with the little negroes, but not with the slave-dealer's\nchildren. If you are obliged to deal with him, you try to get through\nthe job without so much as touching him. It is common with you to join\nhands with the men you meet; but with the slave-dealer you avoid the\nceremony,--instinctively shrinking from the snaky contact. If he grows\nrich and retires from business, you still remember him, and still keep\nup the ban of non-intercourse upon him and his family. Now, why is this?\nYou do not so treat the man who deals in cotton, corn, or tobacco.\n\nAnd yet again. There are in the United States and Territories, including\nthe District of Columbia, over four hundred and thirty thousand free\nblacks. At five hundred dollars per head, they are worth over two\nhundred millions of dollars. How comes this vast amount of property to\nbe running about without owners? We do not see free horses or free\ncattle running at large. How is this? All these free blacks are the\ndescendants of slaves, or have been slaves themselves; and they would be\nslaves now but for something that has operated on their white owners,\ninducing them at vast pecuniary sacrifice to liberate them. What is that\nsomething? Is there any mistaking it? In all these cases it is your\nsense of justice and human sympathy continually telling you that the\npoor negro has some natural right to himself,--that those who deny it\nand make mere merchandise of him deserve kickings, contempt, and death.\n\nAnd now why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave, and\nestimate him as only the equal of the hog? Why ask us to do what you\nwill not do yourselves? Why ask us to do for nothing what two hundred\nmillions of dollars could not induce you to do?\n\nBut one great argument in support of the repeal of the Missouri\nCompromise is still to come. That argument is \"the sacred right of\nself-government.\" ... Some poet has said,--\n\n\"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\"\n\nAt the hazard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation, I\nmeet that argument,--I rush in,--I take that bull by the horns.... My\nfaith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases\nwith all which is exclusively his own, lies at the foundation of the\nsense of justice there is in me. I extend the principle to communities\nof men as well as to individuals. I so extend it because it is\npolitically wise as well as naturally just,--politically wise in saving\nus from broils about matters which do not concern us. Here, or at\nWashington, I would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of Virginia,\nor the cranberry laws of Indiana. The doctrine of self-government is\nright,--absolutely and internally right; but it has no just application\nas here attempted. Or perhaps I should rather say that whether it has\nany application here depends upon whether a negro is not or is a man. If\nhe is not a man, in that case he who is a man may, as a matter of\nself-government, do just what he pleases with him. But if the negro is a\nman, is it not to that extent a total destruction of self-government to\nsay that he, too, shall not govern himself? When the white man governs\nhimself, that is self-government; but when he governs himself and also\ngoverns another man, that is more than self-government,--that is\ndespotism. If the negro is a man, then my ancient faith teaches me that\n\"all men are created equal,\" and that there can be no moral right in\nconnection with one man's making a slave of another.\n\nJudge Douglas frequently, with bitter irony and sarcasm, paraphrases\nour argument by saying: \"The white people of Nebraska are good enough to\ngovern themselves, but they are not good enough to govern a few\nmiserable negroes!\"\n\nWell, I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are and will continue to\nbe as good as the average of people elsewhere. I do not say the\ncontrary. What I do say is that no man is good enough to govern another\nman without that other's consent. I say this is the leading\nprinciple,--the sheet-anchor of American republicanism.\n\nSlavery is founded in the selfishness of man's nature,--opposition to it\nin his love of justice. These principles are in eternal antagonism, and\nwhen brought into collision so fiercely as slavery extension brings\nthem, shocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow. Repeal\nthe Missouri Compromise; repeal all compromises; repeal the Declaration\nof Independence; repeal all past history,--you still cannot repeal human\nnature. It still will be the abundance of man's heart that slavery\nextension is wrong, and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will\ncontinue to speak....\n\nThe Missouri Compromise ought to be restored. Slavery may or may not be\nestablished in Nebraska. But whether it be or not, we shall have\nrepudiated--discarded from the councils of the nation--the spirit of\ncompromise; for who, after this, will ever trust in a national\ncompromise? The spirit of mutual concession--that spirit which first\ngave us the Constitution, and has thrice saved the Union--we shall have\nstrangled and cast from us for ever. And what shall we have in lieu of\nit? The South flushed with triumph and tempted to excess; the North\nbetrayed, as they believed, brooding on wrong and burning for revenge.\nOne side will provoke, the other resent. The one will taunt, the other\ndefy; one aggresses, the other retaliates. Already a few in the North\ndefy all constitutional restraints, resist the execution of the Fugitive\nSlave Law, and even menace the institution of slavery in the States\nwhere it exists. Already a few in the South claim the constitutional\nright to take and hold slaves in the free States, demand the revival of\nthe slave-trade, and demand a treaty with Great Britain by which\nfugitive slaves may be reclaimed from Canada. As yet they are but few on\neither side. It is a grave question for lovers of the Union, whether the\nfinal destruction of the Missouri Compromise, and with it the spirit of\nall compromise, will or will not embolden and embitter each of these,\nand fatally increase the number of both.\n\n... Some men, mostly Whigs, who condemn the repeal of the Missouri\nCompromise, nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration, lest they\nbe thrown in company with the Abolitionists. Will they allow me, as an\nold Whig, to tell them good-humouredly that I think this is very silly?\nStand with anybody that stands right. Stand with him while he is right,\nand part with him when he goes wrong. Stand with the Abolitionist in\nrestoring the Missouri Compromise, and stand against him when he\nattempts to repeal the Fugitive Slave Law. In the latter case you stand\nwith the Southern disunionist. What of that? You are still right. In\nboth cases you are right In both cases you expose the dangerous\nextremes. In both you stand on the middle ground and hold the ship level\nand steady. In both you are national, and nothing less than national.\nThis is the good old Whig ground. To desert such ground because of any\ncompany is to be less than a Whig, less than a man, less than an\nAmerican."

I object to it as a dangerous dalliance for free\npeople--a sad evidence that, feeling over-prosperity, we forget right;\nthat liberty as a principle we have ceased to revere. I object to it\nbecause the Fathers of the Republic eschewed and rejected it. The\nargument of \"necessity\" was the only argument they ever admitted in\nfavour of slavery, and so far, and so far only as it carried them, did\nthey ever go. They found the institution existing among us, which they\ncould not help, and they cast the blame on the British king for having\npermitted its introduction. Thus we see the plain, unmistakable spirit\nof their age towards slavery was hostility to the principle, and\ntoleration only by necessity.\n\nBut now it is to be transformed into a _sacred right_.... Henceforth it\nis to be the chief jewel of the nation,--the very figure-head of the\nship of State. Little by little, but steadily as man's march to the\ngrave, we have been giving up the old for the new faith. Near eighty\nyears ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now\nfrom that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for\nsome men to enslave others is a sacred right of self-government. These\nprinciples cannot stand together. They are as opposite as God and\nMammon; and whoever holds to the one must despise the other....\n\nOur Republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust. Let us purify it.\nLet us turn and wash it white in the spirit if not the blood of the\nRevolution. Let us turn slavery from its claims of moral right, back\nupon its existing legal rights and its arguments of necessity. Let us\nreturn it to the position our fathers gave it, and there let it rest in\npeace. Let us re-adopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it the\npractices and policy which harmonize with it. Let North and South, let\nall Americans, let all lovers of liberty everywhere, join in the great\nand good work. If we do this, we shall not only have saved the Union,\nbut we shall have so saved it as to make and to keep it for ever worthy\nof the saving.\n\n_From Letter to the Hon. Geo. Robertson, Lexington, Kentucky.\nSpringfield, Illinois. August 15, 1855_\n\nMy dear Sir, ... You are not a friend of slavery in the abstract. In\nthat speech you spoke of \"the peaceful extinction of slavery\" and used\nother expressions indicating your belief that the thing was, at some\ntime, to have an end. Since then we have had thirty-six years of\nexperience; and this experience has demonstrated, I think, that there is\nno peaceful extinction of slavery in prospect for us. The signal failure\nof Henry Clay and other good and great men, in 1849, to effect anything\nin favour of gradual emancipation in Kentucky, together with a thousand\nother signs, extinguishes that hope utterly. On the question of liberty,\nas a principle, we are not what we have been. When we were the political\nslaves of King George, and wanted to be free, we called the maxim that\n\"all men are created equal\" a self-evident truth; but now when we have\ngrown fat, and have lost all dread of being slaves ourselves, we have\nbecome so greedy to be _masters_ that we call the same maxim \"a\nself-evident lie.\" The Fourth of July has not quite dwindled away; it is\nstill a great day for burning fire-crackers!\n\nThat spirit which desired the peaceful extinction of slavery has itself\nbecome extinct with the _occasion_ and the _men_ of the Revolution.\nUnder the impulse of that occasion, nearly half the States adopted\nsystems of emancipation at once; and it is a significant fact that not a\nsingle State has done the like since. So far as peaceful, voluntary\nemancipation is concerned, the condition of the negro slave in America,\nscarcely less terrible to the contemplation of the free mind, is now as\nfixed and hopeless of change for the better as that of the lost souls of\nthe finally impenitent. The Autocrat of all the Russias will resign his\ncrown and proclaim his subjects free republicans, sooner than will our\nAmerican masters voluntarily give up their slaves.\n\nOur political problem now is, \"Can we as a nation continue together\n_permanently--for ever_--half slave, and half free?\" The problem is too\nmighty for me. May God in his mercy superintend the solution.\n\nYour much obliged friend, and humble servant,\nA. LINCOLN.\n\n_Extracts from Letter to Joshua F. Speed. August 24, 1855_\n\nYou suggest that in political action now, you and I would differ. I\nsuppose we would; not quite so much, however, as you may think. You know\nI dislike slavery, and you fully admit the abstract wrong of it. So far\nthere is no cause of difference. But you say that sooner than yield your\nlegal right to the slave, especially at the bidding of those who are not\nthemselves interested, you would see the Union dissolved. I am not aware\nthat any one is bidding you yield that right; very certainly I am not. I\nleave that matter entirely to yourself. I also acknowledge your rights\nand my obligations under the Constitution in regard to your slaves. I\nconfess I hate to see the poor creatures hunted down and caught and\ncarried back to their stripes and unrequited toil; but I bite my lips\nand keep quiet. In 1841, you and I had together a tedious low-water trip\non a steamboat, from Louisville to St. Louis. You may remember, as I\nwell do, that from Louisville to the mouth of the Ohio, there were on\nboard ten or a dozen slaves shackled together with irons. That sight was\na continued torment to me, and I see something like it every time I\ntouch the Ohio or any other slave border. It is not fair for you to\nassume that I have no interest in a thing which has, and continually\nexercises, the power of making me miserable. You ought rather to\nappreciate how much the great body of the Northern people do crucify\ntheir feelings in order to maintain their loyalty to the Constitution\nand the Union. I do oppose the extension of slavery, because my judgment\nand feeling so prompt me, and I am under no obligations to the contrary.\nIf for this you and I must differ, differ we must. You say if you were\nPresident, you would send an army and hang the leaders of the Missouri\noutrages upon the Kansas elections; still, if Kansas fairly votes\nherself a slave State she must be admitted, or the Union must be\ndissolved. But how if she votes herself a slave State unfairly; that\nis, by the very means for which you say you would hang men? Must she\nstill be admitted, or the Union dissolved? That will be the phase of the\nquestion when it first becomes a practical one. In your assumption that\nthere may be a fair decision of the slavery question in Kansas, I\nplainly see that you and I would differ about the Nebraska law. I look\nupon that enactment, not as a law, but as a violence from the beginning.\nIt was conceived in violence, is maintained in violence, and is being\nexecuted in violence. I say it was conceived in violence, because the\ndestruction of the Missouri Compromise, under the circumstances, was\nnothing less than violence. It was passed in violence, because it could\nnot have passed at all but for the votes of many members in violence of\nthe known will of their constituents. It is maintained in violence,\nbecause the elections since clearly demand its repeal, and the demand is\nopenly disregarded.\n\nYou say men ought to be hung for the way they are executing the law; I\nsay that the way it is being executed is quite as good as any of its\nantecedents. It is being executed in the precise way which was intended\nfrom the first, else why does no Nebraska man express astonishment or\ncondemnation? Poor Reeder is the only public man who has been silly\nenough to believe that anything like fairness was ever intended, and he\nhas been bravely undeceived."

        "content": "That Kansas will form a slave constitution, and with it ask to be\nadmitted into the Union, I take to be already a settled question, and so\nsettled by the very means you so pointedly condemn. By every principle\nof law ever held by any court North or South, every negro taken to\nKansas _is_ free; yet in utter disregard of this--in the spirit of\nviolence merely--that beautiful Legislature gravely passes a law to hang\nany man who shall venture to inform a negro of his legal rights. This is\nthe subject and real object of the law. If, like Haman, they should hang\nupon the gallows of their own building, I shall not be among the\nmourners for their fate. In my humble sphere, I shall advocate the\nrestoration of the Missouri Compromise so long as Kansas remains a\nTerritory; and when, by all these foul means, it seeks to come into the\nUnion as a slave State, I shall oppose it. I am very loath in any case\nto withhold my assent to the enjoyment of property acquired or located\nin good faith; but I do not admit that good faith in taking a negro to\nKansas to be held in slavery is a probability with any man. Any man who\nhas sense enough to be the controller of his own property has too much\nsense to misunderstand the outrageous character of the whole Nebraska\nbusiness. But I digress. In my opposition to the admission of Kansas, I\nshall have some company, but we may be beaten. If we are, I shall not,\non that account, attempt to dissolve the Union. I think it probable,\nhowever, we shall be beaten. Standing as a unit among yourselves, you\ncan, directly and indirectly, bribe enough of our men to carry the day,\nas you could on the open proposition to establish a monarchy. Get hold\nof some man in the North whose position and ability are such that he can\nmake the support of your measure, whatever it may be, a Democratic-party\nnecessity, and the thing is done. Apropos of this, let me tell you an\nanecdote. Douglas introduced the Nebraska Bill in January. In February\nafterward, there was a called session of the Illinois Legislature. Of\nthe one hundred members composing the two branches of that body, about\nseventy were Democrats. These latter held a caucus, in which the\nNebraska Bill was talked of, if not formally discussed. It was thereby\ndiscovered that just three, and no more, were in favour of the measure.\nIn a day or two Douglas's orders came on to have resolutions passed\napproving the bill; and they were passed by large majorities! The truth\nof this is vouched for by a bolting Democratic member. The masses too,\nDemocratic as well as Whig, were even nearer unanimous against it; but\nas soon as the party necessity of supporting it became apparent, the way\nthe Democrats began to see the wisdom and justice of it was perfectly\nastonishing.\n\nYou say that if Kansas fairly votes herself a free State, as a Christian\nyou will rejoice at it. All decent slaveholders talk that way, and I do\nnot doubt their candour; but they never vote that way. Although in a\nprivate letter or conversation you will express your preference that\nKansas should be free, you would vote for no man for Congress who would\nsay the same thing publicly. No such man could be elected from any\ndistrict in a slave State. You think Stringfellow and company ought to\nbe hung.... The slave-breeders and slave-traders are a small, odious,\nand detested class among you; and yet in politics they dictate the\ncourse of all of you, and are as completely your masters as you are the\nmaster of your own negroes. You inquire where I now stand. That is a\ndisputed point. I think I am a Whig; but others say there are no Whigs,\nand that I am an Abolitionist. When I was at Washington, I voted for the\nWilmot Proviso as good as forty times; and I never heard of any one\nattempting to unwhig me for that. I now do no more than oppose the\nextension of slavery. I am not a Know-nothing; that is certain. How\ncould I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes be in\nfavour of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy\nappears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring\nthat _all men are created equal_. We now practically read it, _all men\nare created equal except negroes_. When the Know-nothings get control,\nit will read, _all men are created equal except negroes_ and foreigners\nand Catholics. When it comes to this, I shall prefer emigrating to some\ncountry where they make no pretence of loving liberty--to Russia, for\ninstance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy\nof hypocrisy.... My kindest regards to Mrs. Speed. On the leading\nsubject of this letter I have more of her sympathy than I have of yours;\nand yet let me say I am your friend for ever.\n\nA. LINCOLN.\n\n_Mr. Lincoln's Speech. May 19, 1856_\n\nMr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I was over at [cries of \"Platform!\" \"Take\nthe platform!\"]--I say, that while I was at Danville Court, some of our\nfriends of anti-Nebraska got together in Springfield and elected me as\none delegate to represent old Sangamon with them in this convention, and\nI am here certainly as a sympathizer in this movement and by virtue of\nthat meeting and selection. But we can hardly be called delegates\nstrictly, inasmuch as, properly speaking, we represent nobody but\nourselves. I think it altogether fair to say that we have no\nanti-Nebraska party in Sangamon, although there is a good deal of\nanti-Nebraska feeling there; but I say for myself, and I think I may\nspeak also for my colleagues, that we who are here fully approve of the\nplatform and of all that has been done [A voice: \"Yes!\"]; and even if we\nare not regularly delegates, it will be right for me to answer your call\nto speak. I suppose we truly stand for the public sentiment of Sangamon\non the great question of the repeal, although we do not yet represent\nmany numbers who have taken a distinct position on the question.\n\nWe are in a trying time--it ranges above mere party--and this movement\nto call a halt and turn our steps backward needs all the help and good\ncounsels it can get; for unless popular opinion makes itself very\nstrongly felt, and a change is made in our present course, _blood will\nflow on account of Nebraska, and brother's hand will be raised against\nbrother_! [The last sentence was uttered in such an earnest, impressive,\nif not, indeed, tragic, manner, as to make a cold chill creep over me.\nOthers gave a similar experience.]\n\nI have listened with great interest to the earnest appeal made to\nIllinois men by the gentleman from Lawrence [James S. Emery] who has\njust addressed us so eloquently and forcibly. I was deeply moved by his\nstatement of the wrongs done to free-State men out there. I think it\njust to say that all true men North should sympathize with them, and\nought to be willing to do any possible and needful thing to right their\nwrongs. But we must not promise what we ought not, lest we be called on\nto perform what we cannot; we must be calm and moderate, and consider\nthe whole difficulty, and determine what is possible and just. We must\nnot be led by excitement and passion to do that which our sober\njudgments would not approve in our cooler moments. We have higher aims;\nwe will have more serious business than to dally with temporary\nmeasures.\n\nWe are here to stand firmly for a principle--to stand firmly for a\nright. We know that great political and moral wrongs are done, and\noutrages committed, and we denounce those wrongs and outrages, although\nwe cannot, at present, do much more. But we desire to reach out beyond\nthose personal outrages and establish a rule that will apply to all, and\nso prevent any future outrages."

We have come\ntogether as in some sort representatives of popular opinion against the\nextension of slavery into territory now free in fact as well as by law,\nand the pledged word of the statesmen of the nation who are now no more.\nWe come--we are here assembled together--to protest as well as we can\nagainst a great wrong, and to take measures, as well as we now can, to\nmake that wrong right; to place the nation, as far as it may be possible\nnow, as it was before the repeal of the Missouri Compromise; and the\nplain way to do this is to restore the Compromise, and to demand and\ndetermine that _Kansas shall be free!_ [Immense applause.] While we\naffirm, and reaffirm, if necessary, our devotion to the principles of\nthe Declaration of Independence, let our practical work here be limited\nto the above. We know that there is not a perfect agreement of sentiment\nhere on the public questions which might be rightfully considered in\nthis convention, and that the indignation which we all must feel cannot\nbe helped; but all of us must give up something for the good of the\ncause. There is one desire which is uppermost in the mind, one wish\ncommon to us all--to which no dissent will be made; and I counsel you\nearnestly to bury all resentment, to sink all personal feeling, make all\nthings work to a common purpose in which we are united and agreed about,\nand which all present will agree is absolutely necessary--which _must_\nbe done by any rightful mode if there be such: _Slavery must be kept out\nof Kansas_! [Applause.] The test--the pinch--is right there. If we lose\nKansas to freedom, an example will be set which will prove fatal to\nfreedom in the end. We, therefore, in the language of the _Bible_, must\n\"lay the axe to the root of the tree.\" Temporizing will not do longer;\nnow is the time for decision--for firm, persistent, resolute action.\n[Applause.]\n\nThe Nebraska bill, or rather Nebraska law, is not one of wholesome\nlegislation, but was and is an act of legislative usurpation, whose\nresult, if not indeed intention, is to make slavery national; and unless\nheaded off in some effective way, we are in a fair way to see this land\nof boasted freedom converted into a land of slavery in fact.\n[Sensation.] Just open your two eyes, and see if this be not so. I need\ndo no more than state, to command universal approval, that almost the\nentire North, as well as a large following in the border States, is\nradically opposed to the planting of slavery in free territory. Probably\nin a popular vote throughout the nation nine-tenths of the voters in the\nfree States, and at least one-half in the border States, if they could\nexpress their sentiments freely, would vote NO on such an issue; and it\nis safe to say that two-thirds of the votes of the entire nation would\nbe opposed to it. And yet, in spite of this overbalancing of sentiment\nin this free country, we are in a fair way to see Kansas present itself\nfor admission as a slave State. Indeed, it is a felony, by the local law\nof Kansas, to deny that slavery exists there even now. By every\nprinciple of law, a negro in Kansas is free; yet the _bogus_\nlegislature makes it an infamous crime to tell him that he is free!\n\nThe party lash and the fear of ridicule will overawe justice and\nliberty; for it is a singular fact, but none the less a fact, and well\nknown by the most common experience, that men will do things under the\nterror of the party lash that they would not on any account or for any\nconsideration do otherwise; while men who will march up to the mouth of\na loaded cannon without shrinking, will run from the terrible name of\n\"Abolitionist,\" even when pronounced by a worthless creature whom they,\nwith good reason, despise. For instance--to press this point a\nlittle--Judge Douglas introduced his anti-Nebraska bill in January; and\nwe had an extra session of our legislature in the succeeding February,\nin which were seventy-five Democrats; and at a party caucus, fully\nattended, there were just three votes out of the whole seventy-five, for\nthe measure. But in a few days orders came on from Washington,\ncommanding them to approve the measure; the party lash was applied, and\nit was brought up again in caucus, and passed by a large majority. The\nmasses were against it, but party necessity carried it; and it was\npassed through the lower house of Congress against the will of the\npeople, for the same reason. Here is where the greatest danger\nlies--that, while we profess to be a government of law and reason, law\nwill give way to violence on demand of this awful and crushing power.\nLike the great Juggernaut--I think that is the name--the great idol, it\ncrushes everything that comes in its way, and makes a--or as I read\nonce, in a black-letter law book, \"a slave is a human being who is\nlegally not a _person_, but a _thing_.\" And if the safeguards to liberty\nare broken down, as is now attempted, when they have made _things_ of\nall the free negroes, how long, think you, before they will begin to\nmake _things_ of poor white men? [Applause.] Be not deceived.\nRevolutions do not go backward. The founder of the Democratic party\ndeclared that _all_ men were created equal. His successor in the\nleadership has written the word \"white\" before men, making it read \"all\n_white_ men are created equal.\" Pray, will or may not the Know-nothings,\nif they should get in power, add the word \"protestant,\" making it read\n\"_all protestant white men_\"?\n\nMeanwhile the hapless negro is the fruitful subject of reprisals in\nother quarters. John Pettit, whom Tom Benton paid his respects to, you\nwill recollect, calls the immortal Declaration \"a self-evident lie;\"\nwhile at the birth-place of freedom--in the shadow of Bunker Hill and of\nthe \"cradle of liberty,\" at the home of the Adamses and Warren and\nOtis--Choate, from our side of the house, dares to fritter away the\nbirthday promise of liberty by proclaiming the Declaration to be \"a\nstring of glittering generalities;\" and the Southern Whigs, working hand\nin hand with pro-slavery Democrats, are making Choate's theories\npractical. Thomas Jefferson, a slaveholder, mindful of the moral element\nin slavery, solemnly declared that he \"trembled for his country when he\nremembered that God is just;\" while Judge Douglas, with an insignificant\nwave of the hand, \"don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted\ndown.\" Now, if slavery is right, or even negative, he has a right to\ntreat it in this trifling manner. But if it is a moral and political\nwrong, as all Christendom considers it to be, how can he answer to God\nfor this attempt to spread and fortify it? [Applause.]\n\nBut no man, and Judge Douglas no more than any other, can maintain a\nnegative, or merely neutral, position on this question; and,\naccordingly, he avows that the Union was made _by_ white men and _for_\nwhite men and their descendants. As matter of fact, the first branch of\nthe proposition is historically true; the government was made by white\nmen, and they were and are the superior race. This I admit. But the\ncorner-stone of the government, so to speak, was the declaration that\n\"_all_ men are created equal,\" and all entitled to \"life, liberty, and\nthe pursuit of happiness.\" [Applause.]"

[Applause.] Nor is it any argument that we are\nsuperior and the negro inferior--that he has but one talent while we\nhave ten. Let the negro possess the little he has in independence; if he\nhas but one talent, he should be permitted to keep the little he has.\n[Applause.] But slavery will endure no test of reason or logic; and yet\nits advocates, like Douglas, use a sort of bastard logic, or noisy\nassumption, it might better be termed, like the above, in order to\nprepare the mind for the gradual, but none the less certain,\nencroachments of the Moloch of slavery upon, the fair domain of freedom.\nBut however much you may argue upon it, or smother it in soft phrases,\nslavery can only be maintained by force--by violence. The repeal of the\nMissouri Compromise was by violence. It was a violation of both law and\nthe sacred obligations of honour, to overthrow and trample underfoot a\nsolemn compromise, obtained by the fearful loss to freedom of one of the\nfairest of our Western domains. Congress violated the will and\nconfidence of its constituents in voting for the bill; and while public\nsentiment, as shown by the elections of 1854, demanded the restoration\nof this compromise, Congress violated its trust by refusing, simply\nbecause it had the force of numbers to hold on to it. And murderous\nviolence is being used now, in order to force slavery on to Kansas; for\nit cannot be done in any other way. [Sensation.]\n\nThe necessary result was to establish the rule of violence--force,\ninstead of the rule of law and reason; to perpetuate and spread slavery,\nand, in time, to make it general. We see it at both ends of the line. In\nWashington, on the very spot where the outrage was started, the fearless\nSumner is beaten to insensibility, and is now slowly dying; while\nsenators who claim to be gentlemen and Christians stood by,\ncountenancing the act, and even applauding it afterward in their places\nin the Senate. Even Douglas, our man, saw it all and was within helping\ndistance, yet let the murderous blows fall unopposed. Then, at the other\nend of the line, at the very time Sumner was being murdered, Lawrence\nwas being destroyed for the crime of Freedom. It was the most prominent\nstronghold of liberty in Kansas, and must give way to the all-dominating\npower of slavery. Only two days ago, Judge Trumbull found it necessary\nto propose a bill in the Senate to prevent a general civil war and to\nrestore peace in Kansas.\n\nWe live in the midst of alarms; anxiety beclouds the future; we expect\nsome new disaster with each newspaper we read. Are we in a healthful\npolitical state? Are not the tendencies plain? Do not the signs of the\ntimes point plainly the way in which we are going? [Sensation.]\n\nIn the early days of the Constitution slavery was recognized, by South\nand North alike, as an evil, and the division of sentiment about it was\nnot controlled by geographical lines or considerations of climate, but\nby moral and philanthropic views. Petitions for the abolition of slavery\nwere presented to the very first Congress by Virginia and Massachusetts\nalike. To show the harmony which prevailed, I will state that a fugitive\nslave law was passed in 1793, with no dissenting voice in the Senate,\nand but seven dissenting votes in the House. It was, however, a wise\nlaw, moderate, and, under the Constitution, a just one. Twenty-five\nyears later, a more stringent law was proposed and defeated; and\nthirty-five years after that, the present law, drafted by Mason of\nVirginia, was passed by Northern votes. I am not, just now, complaining\nof this law, but I am trying to show how the current sets; for the\nproposed law of 1817 was far less offensive than the present one. In\n1774 the Continental Congress pledged itself, without a dissenting vote,\nto wholly discontinue the slave trade, and to neither purchase nor\nimport any slave: and less than three months before the passage of the\nDeclaration of Independence, the same Congress which adopted that\ndeclaration unanimously resolved \"that _no slave be imported into any of\nthe thirteen United Colonies_.\" [Great applause.]\n\nOn the second day of July, 1776, the draft of a Declaration of\nIndependence was reported to Congress by the committee, and in it the\nslave trade was characterized as \"an execrable commerce,\" as \"a\npiratical warfare,\" as the \"opprobrium of infidel powers,\" and as \"a\ncruel war against human nature.\" [Applause.] All agreed on this except\nSouth Carolina and Georgia, and in order to preserve harmony, and from\nthe necessity of the case, these expressions were omitted. Indeed,\nabolition societies existed as far south as Virginia; and it is a\nwell-known fact that Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Lee, Henry, Mason,\nand Pendleton were qualified abolitionists, and much more radical on\nthat subject than we of the Whig and Democratic parties claim to be\nto-day. On March 1, 1784, Virginia ceded to the confederation all its\nlands lying northwest of the Ohio River. Jefferson, Chase of Maryland,\nand Howell of Rhode Island, as a committee on that and territory\nthereafter _to be ceded_, reported that no slavery should exist after\nthe year 1800. Had this report been adopted, not only the Northwest, but\nKentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi also would have been free;\nbut it required the assent of nine States to ratify it. North Carolina\nwas divided, and thus its vote was lost; and Delaware, Georgia, and New\nJersey refused to vote. In point of fact, as it was, it was assented to\nby six States. Three years later, on a square vote to exclude slavery\nfrom the Northwest, only one vote, and that from New York, was against\nit. And yet, thirty-seven years later, five thousand citizens of\nIllinois out of a voting mass of less than twelve thousand,\ndeliberately, after a long and heated contest, voted to introduce\nslavery in Illinois; and, to-day, a large party in the free State of\nIllinois are willing to vote to fasten the shackles of slavery on the\nfair domain of Kansas, notwithstanding it received the dowry of freedom\nlong before its birth as a political community. I repeat, therefore, the\nquestion, Is it not plain in what direction we are tending? [Sensation.]\nIn the colonial time, Mason, Pendleton, and Jefferson were as hostile to\nslavery in Virginia as Otis, Ames, and the Adamses were in\nMassachusetts; and Virginia made as earnest an effort to get rid of it\nas old Massachusetts did. But circumstances were against them and they\nfailed; but not that the good-will of its leading men was lacking. Yet\nwithin less than fifty years Virginia changed its tune, and made\nnegro-breeding for the cotton and sugar States one of its leading\nindustries. [Laughter and applause.]\n\nIn the Constitutional Convention, George Mason of Virginia made a more\nviolent abolition speech than my friends Lovejoy or Codding would desire\nto make here to-day--a speech which could not be safely repeated\nanywhere on Southern soil in this enlightened year. But while there were\nsome differences of opinion on this subject even then, discussion was\nallowed; but as you see by the Kansas slave code, which, as you know, is\nthe Missouri slave code, merely ferried across the river, it is a felony\nto even express an opinion hostile to that foul blot in the land of\nWashington and the Declaration of Independence.

[Applause.]\n\nEvery Fourth of July our young orators all proclaim this to be \"the land\nof the _free_ and the home of the brave!\" Well, now, when you orators\nget that off next year, and, may be, this very year, how would you like\nsome old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it? [Laughter.]\nHow would you like that? But suppose Kansas comes in as a slave State,\nand all the \"border ruffians\" have barbecues about it, and free-State\nmen come trailing back to the dishonoured North, like whipped dogs with\ntheir tails between their legs, it is--ain't it?--evident that this is\nno more the \"land of the free;\" and if we let it go so, we won't dare to\nsay \"home of the brave\" out loud. [Sensation and confusion.]\n\nCan any man doubt that, even in spite of the people's will, slavery will\ntriumph through violence, unless that will be made manifest and\nenforced? Even Governor Reeder claimed at the outset that the contest in\nKansas was to be fair, but he got his eyes open at last; and I believe\nthat, as a result of this moral and physical violence, Kansas will soon\napply for admission as a slave State. And yet we can't mistake that the\npeople don't want it so, and that it is a land which is free both by\nnatural and political law. _No law is free law!_ Such is the\nunderstanding of all Christendom. In the Somerset case, decided nearly a\ncentury ago, the great Lord Mansfield held that slavery was of such a\nnature that it must take its rise in _positive_ (as distinguished from\n_natural_) law; and that in no country or age could it be traced back to\nany other source. Will some one please tell me where is the _positive_\nlaw that establishes slavery in Kansas? [A voice: \"The _bogus_ laws.\"]\nAye, the _bogus_ laws! And, on the same principle, a gang of Missouri\nhorse-thieves could come into Illinois and declare horse-stealing to be\nlegal [Laughter], and it would be just as legal as slavery is in Kansas.\nBut by express statute, in the land of Washington and Jefferson, we may\nsoon be brought face to face with the discreditable fact of showing to\nthe world by our acts that we prefer slavery to freedom--darkness to\nlight! [Sensation.]\n\nIt is, I believe, a principle in law that when one party to a contract\nviolates it so grossly as to chiefly destroy the object for which it is\nmade, the other party may rescind it. I will ask Browning if that ain't\ngood law. [Voices: \"Yes!\"] Well, now if that be right, I go for\nrescinding the whole, entire Missouri Compromise and thus turning\nMissouri into a free State; and I should like to know the\ndifference--should like for any one to point out the difference--between\n_our_ making a free State of Missouri and _their_ making a slave State\nof Kansas. [Great applause.] There ain't one bit of difference, except\nthat our way would be a great mercy to humanity. But I have never\nsaid--and the Whig party has never said--and those who oppose the\nNebraska bill do not as a body say, that they have any intention of\ninterfering with slavery in the slave States. Our platform says just the\ncontrary. We allow slavery to exist in the slave States--not because\nslavery is right or good, but from the necessities of our Union. We\ngrant a fugitive slave law because it is so \"nominated in the bond;\"\nbecause our fathers so stipulated--had to--and we are bound to carry out\nthis agreement. But they did not agree to introduce slavery in regions\nwhere it did not previously exist. On the contrary, they said by their\nexample and teachings that they did not deem it expedient--did not\nconsider it right--to do so; and it is wise and right to do just as they\ndid about it [Voices: \"Good!\"], and that is what we propose--not to\ninterfere with slavery where it exists (we have never tried to do it),\nand to give them a reasonable and efficient fugitive slave law. [A\nvoice: \"No!\"] I say YES! [Applause.] It was part of the bargain, and I'm\nfor living up to it; but I go no further; I'm not bound to do more, and\nI won't agree any further. [Great applause.]\n\nWe, here in Illinois, should feel especially proud of the provision of\nthe Missouri Compromise excluding slavery from what is now Kansas; for\nan Illinois man, Jesse B. Thomas, was its father. Henry Clay, who is\ncredited with the authorship of the Compromise in general terms, did not\neven vote for that provision, but only advocated the ultimate admission\nby a second compromise; and, Thomas was, beyond all controversy, the\nreal author of the \"slavery restriction\" branch of the Compromise. To\nshow the generosity of the Northern members toward the Southern side; on\na test vote to exclude slavery from Missouri, ninety voted not to\nexclude, and eighty-seven to exclude, every vote from the slave States\nbeing ranged with the former and fourteen votes from the free States,\nof whom seven were from New England alone; while on a vote to exclude\nslavery from what is now Kansas, the vote was one hundred and\nthirty-four _for_ to forty-two _against_. The scheme, as a whole, was,\nof course, a Southern triumph. It is idle to contend otherwise, as is\nnow being done by the Nebraskaites; it was so shown by the votes and\nquite as emphatically by the expressions of representative men. Mr.\nLowndes of South Carolina was never known to commit a political mistake;\nhis was the great judgment of that section; and he declared that this\nmeasure \"would restore tranquillity to the country--a result demanded by\nevery consideration of discretion, of moderation, of wisdom, and of\nvirtue.\" When the measure came before President Monroe for his approval,\nhe put to each member of his cabinet this question: \"Has Congress the\nconstitutional power to prohibit slavery in a territory?\" And John C.\nCalhoun and William H. Crawford from the South, equally with John Quincy\nAdams, Benjamin Rush, and Smith Thompson from the North, alike answered,\n\"_Yes!_\" without qualification or equivocation; and this measure, of so\ngreat consequence to the South, was passed; and Missouri was, by means\nof it, finally enabled to knock at the door of the Republic for an open\npassage to its brood of slaves. And, in spite of this, Freedom's share\nis about to be taken by violence--by the force of misrepresentative\nvotes, not called for by the popular will. What name can I, in common\ndecency, give to this wicked transaction? [Sensation.]"

        "content": "But even then the contest was not over; for when the Missouri\nconstitution came before Congress for its approval, it forbade any free\nnegro or mulatto from entering the State. In short, our Illinois \"black\nlaws\" were hidden away in their constitution [Laughter], and the\ncontroversy was thus revived. Then it was that Mr. Clay's talents shone\nout conspicuously, and the controversy that shook the Union to its\nfoundation was finally settled to the satisfaction of the conservative\nparties on both sides of the line, though not to the extremists on\neither, and Missouri was admitted by the small majority of six in the\nlower House. How great a majority, do you think, would have been given\nhad Kansas also been secured for slavery? [A voice: \"A majority the\nother way.\"] \"A majority the other way,\" is answered. Do you think it\nwould have been safe for a Northern man to have confronted his\nconstituents after having voted to consign both Missouri and Kansas to\nhopeless slavery? And yet this man Douglas, who misrepresents his\nconstituents, and who has exerted his highest talents in that direction,\nwill be carried in triumph through the State, and hailed with honour\nwhile applauding that act. [Three groans for \"_Dug_!\"] And this shows\nwhither we are tending. This thing of slavery is more powerful than its\nsupporters--even than the high priests that minister at its altar. It\ndebauches even our greatest men. It gathers strength, like a rolling\nsnow-ball, by its own infamy. Monstrous crimes are committed in its name\nby persons collectively which they would not dare to commit as\nindividuals. Its aggressions and encroachments almost surpass belief. In\na despotism, one might not wonder to see slavery advance steadily and\nremorselessly into new dominions; but is it not wonderful, is it not\neven alarming, to see its steady advance in a land dedicated to the\nproposition that \"all men are created equal\"? [Sensation.]\n\nIt yields nothing itself; it keeps all it has, and gets all it can\nbesides. It really came dangerously near securing Illinois in 1824; it\ndid get Missouri in 1821. The first proposition was to admit what is now\nArkansas _and_ Missouri as one slave State. But the territory was\ndivided, and Arkansas came in, without serious question, as a slave\nState; and afterward Missouri, not as a sort of equality, _free_, but\nalso as a slave State. Then we had Florida and Texas; and now Kansas is\nabout to be forced into the dismal procession. [Sensation.] And so it is\nwherever you look. We have not forgotten--it is but six years since--how\ndangerously near California came to being a slave State. Texas is a\nslave State, and four other slave States may be carved from its vast\ndomain. And yet, in the year 1829, slavery was abolished throughout\nthat vast region by a royal decree of the then sovereign of Mexico. Will\nyou please tell me by what _right_ slavery exists in Texas to-day? By\nthe same right as, and no higher or greater than, slavery is seeking\ndominion in Kansas: by political force--peaceful, if that will suffice;\nby the torch (as in Kansas) and the bludgeon (as in the Senate chamber),\nif required. And so history repeats itself; and even as slavery has kept\nits course by craft, intimidation, and violence in the past, so it will\npersist, in my judgment, until met and dominated by the will of a people\nbent on its restriction.\n\nWe have, this very afternoon, heard bitter denunciations of Brooks in\nWashington, and Titus, Stringfellow, Atchison, Jones, and Shannon in\nKansas--the battle-ground of slavery. I certainly am not going to\nadvocate or shield them; but they and their acts are but the necessary\noutcome of the Nebraska law. We should reserve our highest censure for\nthe authors of the mischief, and not for the catspaws which they use. I\nbelieve it was Shakespeare who said, \"Where the offence lies, there let\nthe axe fall;\" and, in my opinion, this man Douglas and the Northern men\nin Congress who advocate \"Nebraska\" are more guilty than a thousand\nJoneses and Stringfellows, with all their murderous practices, can be.\n[Applause.]\n\nWe have made a good beginning here to-day. As our Methodist friends\nwould say, \"I feel it is good to be here.\" While extremists may find\nsome fault with the moderation of our platform, they should recollect\nthat \"the battle is not always to the strong, nor the race to the\nswift.\" In grave emergencies, moderation is generally safer than\nradicalism: and as this struggle is likely to be long and earnest, we\nmust not, by our action, repel any who are in sympathy with us in the\nmain, but rather win all that we can to our standard. We must not\nbelittle nor overlook the facts of our condition--that we are new and\ncomparatively weak, while our enemies are entrenched and relatively\nstrong. They have the administration and the political power; and, right\nor wrong, at present they have the numbers. Our friends who urge an\nappeal to arms with so much force and eloquence, should recollect that\nthe government is arrayed against us, and that the numbers are now\narrayed against us as well; or, to state it nearer to the truth, they\nare not yet expressly and affirmatively for us; and we should repel\nfriends rather than gain them by anything savouring of revolutionary\nmethods. As it now stands, we must appeal to the sober sense and\npatriotism of the people. We will make converts day by day; we will grow\nstrong by calmness and moderation; we will grow strong by the violence\nand injustice of our adversaries. And, unless truth be a mockery and\njustice a hollow lie, we will be in the majority after a while, and then\nthe revolution which we will accomplish will be none the less radical\nfrom being the result of pacific measures. The battle of freedom is to\nbe fought out on principle. Slavery is a violation of the eternal right.\nWe have temporized with it from the necessities of our condition; but\n_as sure as God reigns and school children read_, THAT BLACK FOUL LIE\nCAN NEVER BE CONSECRATED INTO GOD'S HALLOWED TRUTH! [Immense applause\nlasting some time.] One of our greatest difficulties is, that men who\n_know_ that slavery is a detestable crime and ruinous to the nation, are\ncompelled, by our peculiar condition and other circumstances, to\nadvocate it concretely, though damning it in the raw. Henry Clay was a\nbrilliant example of this tendency; others of our purest statesmen are\ncompelled to do so; and thus slavery secures actual support from those\nwho detest it at heart. Yet Henry Clay perfected and forced through the\nCompromise which secured to slavery a great State as well as a political\nadvantage. Not that he hated slavery less, but that he loved the whole\nUnion more. As long as slavery profited by his great Compromise, the\nhosts of pro-slavery could not sufficiently cover him with praise; but\nnow that this Compromise stands in their way--\n\n\"...they never mention him,\nHis name is never heard:\nTheir lips are now forbid to speak\nThat once familiar word.\"\n\nThey have slaughtered one of his most cherished measures, and his ghost\nwould arise to rebuke them.

        "content": "Now, let us harmonize, my friends, and appeal to the moderation and\npatriotism of the people: to the sober second thought; to the awakened\npublic conscience. The repeal of the sacred Missouri Compromise has\ninstalled the weapons of violence: the bludgeon, the incendiary torch,\nthe death-dealing rifle, the bristling cannon--the weapons of kingcraft,\nof the inquisition, of ignorance, of barbarism, of oppression. We see\nits fruits in the dying bed of the heroic Sumner; in the ruins of the\n\"Free State\" hotel; in the smoking embers of the _Herald of Freedom_; in\nthe free-State Governor of Kansas chained to a stake on freedom's soil\nlike a horse-thief, for the crime of freedom. [Applause.] We see it in\nChristian statesmen, and Christian newspapers, and Christian pulpits,\napplauding _the cowardly act of a low bully_, WHO CRAWLED UPON HIS\nVICTIM BEHIND HIS BACK AND DEALT THE DEADLY BLOW. [Sensation and\napplause.] We note our political demoralization in the catch-words that\nare coming into such common use; on the one hand, \"freedom-shriekers,\"\nand sometimes \"freedom-screechers\" [Laughter]; and, on the other hand,\n\"border ruffians,\" and that fully deserved. And the significance of\ncatch-words cannot pass unheeded, for they constitute a sign of the\ntimes. Everything in this world \"jibes\" in with everything else, and all\nthe fruits of this Nebraska bill are like the poisoned source from which\nthey come. I will not say that we may not sooner or later be compelled\nto meet force by force; but the time has not yet come, and if we are\ntrue to ourselves, may never come. Do not mistake that the ballot is\nstronger than the bullet. Therefore let the legions of slavery use\nbullets; but let us wait patiently till November, and fire ballots at\nthem in return; and by that peaceful policy, I believe we shall\nultimately win. [Applause.]\n\nIt was by that policy that here in Illinois the early fathers fought the\ngood fight and gained the victory. In 1824 the free men of our State,\nled by Governor Coles (who was a native of Maryland and President\nMadison's private secretary), determined that those beautiful groves\nshould never re-echo the dirge of one who has no title to himself. By\ntheir resolute determination, the winds that sweep across our broad\nprairies shall never cool the parched brow, nor shall the unfettered\nstreams that bring joy and gladness to our free soil water the tired\nfeet, of a _slave_; but so long as those heavenly breezes and sparkling\nstreams bless the land, or the groves and their fragrance or their\nmemory remain, the humanity to which they minister SHALL BE FOR EVER\nFREE! [Great applause.] Palmer, Yates, Williams, Browning, and some more\nin this convention came from Kentucky to Illinois (instead of going to\nMissouri), not only to better their conditions, but also to get away\nfrom slavery. They have said so to me, and it is understood among us\nKentuckians that we don't like it one bit. Now, can we, mindful of the\nblessings of liberty which the early men of Illinois left to us, refuse\na like privilege to the free men who seek to plant Freedom's banner on\nour Western outposts? [\"No! No!\"] Should we not stand by our neighbours\nwho seek to better their conditions in Kansas and Nebraska? [\"Yes!\nYes!\"] Can we as Christian men, and strong and free ourselves, wield the\nsledge or hold the iron which is to manacle anew an already oppressed\nrace? [\"No! No!\"] \"Woe unto them,\" it is written, \"that decree\nunrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have\nprescribed.\" Can we afford to sin any more deeply against human liberty?\n[\"No! No!\"]\n\nOne great trouble in the matter is, that slavery is an insidious and\ncrafty power, and gains equally by open violence of the brutal as well\nas by sly management of the peaceful. Even after the ordinance of 1787,\nthe settlers in Indiana and Illinois (it was all one government then)\ntried to get Congress to allow slavery temporarily, and petitions to\nthat end were sent from Kaskaskia, and General Harrison, the Governor,\nurged it from Vincennes the capital. If that had succeeded, good-bye to\nliberty here. But John Randolph of Virginia made a vigorous report\nagainst it; and although they persevered so well as to get three\nfavourable reports for it, yet the United States Senate, with the aid of\nsome slave States, finally _squelched_ it for good. [Applause.] And that\nis why this hall is to-day a temple for free men instead of a negro\nlivery stable. [Great applause and laughter.] Once let slavery get\nplanted in a locality, by ever so weak or doubtful a title, and in ever\nso small numbers, and it is like the Canada thistle or Bermuda\ngrass--you can't root it out. You yourself may detest slavery; but your\nneighbour has five or six slaves, and he is an excellent neighbour, or\nyour son has married his daughter, and they beg you to help save their\nproperty, and you vote against your interest and principles to\naccommodate a neighbour, hoping that your vote will be on the losing\nside. And others do the same; and in those ways slavery gets a sure\nfoothold. And when that is done the whole mighty Union--the force of the\nnation--is committed to its support. And that very process is working in\nKansas to-day. And you must recollect that the slave property is worth a\nbillion of dollars ($1,000,000,000); while free-State men must work for\nsentiment alone. Then there are \"blue lodges\"--as they call\nthem--everywhere doing their secret and deadly work.\n\nIt is a very strange thing, and not solvable by any moral law that I\nknow of, that if a man loses his horse, the whole country will turn out\nto help hang the thief; but if a man but a shade or two darker than I am\nis himself stolen, the same crowd will hang one who aids in restoring\nhim to liberty. Such are the inconsistencies of slavery, where a horse\nis more sacred than a man; and the essence of _squatter_ or popular\nsovereignty--I don't care how you call it--is that if one man chooses to\nmake a slave of another, no third man shall be allowed to object. And if\nyou can do this in free Kansas, and it is allowed to stand, the next\nthing you will see is ship-loads of negroes from Africa at the wharf at\nCharleston; for one thing is as truly lawful as the other; and these\nare the bastard notions we have got to stamp out, else they will stamp\nus out.

I do not mean that it is\ntrue in essence, as he would have us believe. It could not be\nessentially true if the ordinance of '87 was valid. But, in point of\nfact, there were some degraded beings called slaves in Kaskaskia and the\nother French settlements when our first State constitution was adopted;\nthat is a fact, and I don't deny it. Slaves were brought here as early\nas 1720, and were kept here in spite of the ordinance of 1787 against\nit. But slavery did not thrive here. On the contrary, under the\ninfluence of the ordinance, the number _decreased_ fifty-one from 1810\nto 1820; while under the influence of _squatter_ sovereignty, right\nacross the river in Missouri, they _increased_ seven thousand two\nhundred and eleven in the same time; and slavery finally faded out in\nIllinois, under the influence of the law of freedom, while it grew\nstronger and stronger in Missouri, under the law or practice of \"popular\nsovereignty.\" In point of fact there were but one hundred and seventeen\nslaves in Illinois one year after its admission, or one to every four\nhundred and seventy of its population; or, to state it in another way,\nif Illinois was a slave State in 1820, so were New York and New Jersey\nmuch greater slave States from having had greater numbers, slavery\nhaving been established there in very early times. But there is this\nvital difference between all these States and the judge's Kansas\nexperiment: that they sought to disestablish slavery which had been\nalready established, while the judge seeks, so far as he can, to\ndisestablish freedom, which had been established there by the Missouri\nCompromise. [Voices: \"Good!\"]\n\nThe Union is undergoing a fearful strain; but it is a stout old ship,\nand has weathered many a hard blow, and \"the stars in their courses,\"\naye, an invisible power, greater than the puny efforts of men, will\nfight for us. But we ourselves must not decline the burden of\nresponsibility, nor take counsel of unworthy passions. Whatever duty\nurges us to do or to omit, must be done or omitted; and the recklessness\nwith which our adversaries break the laws, or counsel their violation,\nshould afford no example for us. Therefore, let us revere the\nDeclaration of Independence; let us continue to obey the Constitution\nand the laws; let us keep step to the music of the Union. Let us draw a\ncordon, so to speak, around the slave States, and the hateful\ninstitution, like a reptile poisoning itself, will perish by its own\ninfamy. [Applause.]\n\nBut we cannot be free men if this is, by our national choice, to be a\nland of slavery. Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for\nthemselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.\n[Loud applause.]\n\nDid you ever, my friends, seriously reflect upon the speed with which we\nare tending downward? Within the memory of men now present the leading\nstatesmen of Virginia could make genuine, red-hot abolitionist speeches\nin old Virginia; and, as I have said, now even in \"free Kansas\" it is a\ncrime to declare that it is \"free Kansas.\" The very sentiments that I\nand others have just uttered would entitle us, and each of us, to the\nignominy and seclusion of a dungeon; and yet I suppose that, like Paul,\nwe were \"free born.\" But if this thing is allowed to continue, it will\nbe but one step further to impress the same rule in Illinois.\n[Sensation.]\n\nThe conclusion of all is, that we must restore the Missouri Compromise.\nWe must highly resolve that _Kansas must be free_! [Great applause.] We\nmust reinstate the birthday promise of the Republic; we must reaffirm\nthe Declaration of Independence; we must make good in essence as well as\nin form Madison's vowal that \"the word _slave_ ought not to appear in\nthe Constitution;\" and we must even go further, and decree that only\nlocal law, and not that time-honoured instrument, shall shelter a\nslave-holder. We must make this a land of liberty in fact, as it is in\nname. But in seeking to attain these results--so indispensable if the\nliberty which is our pride and boast shall endure--we will be loyal to\nthe Constitution and to the \"flag of our Union,\" and no matter what our\ngrievance--even though Kansas shall come in as a slave State; and no\nmatter what theirs--even if we shall restore the Compromise--WE WILL SAY\nTO THE SOUTHERN DISUNIONISTS, WE WON'T GO OUT OF THE UNION, AND YOU\nSHAN'T!!! [This was the climax; the audience rose to its feet _en\nmasse_, applauded, stamped, waved handkerchiefs, threw hats in the air,\nand ran riot for several minutes. The arch-enchanter who wrought this\ntransformation looked, meanwhile, like the personification of political\njustice.]\n\nBut let us, meanwhile, appeal to the sense and patriotism of the people,\nand not to their prejudices; let us spread the floods of enthusiasm here\naroused all over these vast prairies, so suggestive of freedom. Let us\ncommence by electing the gallant soldier Governor (Colonel) Bissell who\nstood for the honour of our State alike on the plains and amidst the\nchaparral of Mexico and on the floor of Congress, while he defied the\nSouthern Hotspur; and that will have a greater moral effect than all the\nborder ruffians can accomplish in all their raids on Kansas. There is\nboth a power and a magic in popular opinion. To that let us now appeal;\nand while, in all probability, no resort to force will be needed, our\nmoderation and forbearance will stand us in good stead when, if ever, WE\nMUST MAKE AN APPEAL TO BATTLE AND TO THE GOD OF HOSTS!! [Immense\napplause and a rush for the orator.]\n\nThis speech has been called Lincoln's \"Lost Speech,\" because all the\nreporters present were so carried away by his eloquence that they one\nand all forgot to take any notes. If it had not been for a young lawyer,\na Mr. H.C. Whitney, who kept his head sufficiently to take notes, we\nwould have no record of it. Mr. Whitney wrote out the speech for\nMcClure's Magazine in 1896. It was submitted to several people who were\npresent at the Bloomington Convention, and they said it was remarkably\naccurate considering that it was not taken down stenographically.\n\n_From his Speech on the Dred Scott Decision. Springfield, Illinois. June\n26, 1857_\n\n... And now as to the Dred Scott decision. That decision declares two\npropositions,--first, that a negro cannot sue in the United States\ncourts; and secondly, that Congress cannot prohibit slavery in the\nTerritories. It was made by a divided court,--dividing differently on\nthe different points. Judge Douglas does not discuss the merits of the\ndecision, and in that respect I shall follow his example, believing I\ncould no more improve on McLean and Curtis than he could on Taney.\n\nHe denounces all who question the correctness of that decision, as\noffering violent resistance to it. But who resists it? Who has, in spite\nof the decision, declared Dred Scott free, and resisted the authority of\nhis master over him?\n\nJudicial decisions have two uses: first, to absolutely determine the\ncase decided; and secondly, to indicate to the public how other similar\ncases will be decided when they arise.

We think its\ndecisions on constitutional questions, when fully settled, should\ncontrol not only the particular cases decided, but the general policy of\nthe country, subject to be disturbed only by amendments of the\nConstitution, as provided in that instrument itself. More than this\nwould be revolution. But we think the Dred Scott decision is erroneous.\nWe know the court that made it has often overruled its own decisions,\nand we shall do what we can to have it overrule this. We offer no\nresistance to it.\n\nJudicial decisions are of greater or less authority as precedents\naccording to circumstances. That this should be so, accords both with\ncommon-sense and the customary understanding of the legal profession.\n\nIf this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence of\nthe judges, and without any apparent partisan bias, and in accordance\nwith legal public expectation, and with the steady practice of the\ndepartments throughout our history, and had been in no part based on\nassumed historical facts, which are not really true; or if wanting in\nsome of these, it had been before the court more than once, and had\nthere been affirmed and reaffirmed through a course of years,--it then\nmight be, perhaps would be factious, nay, even revolutionary, not to\nacquiesce in it as a precedent.\n\nBut when, as is true, we find it wanting in all these claims to the\npublic confidence, it is not resistance, it is not factious, it is not\neven disrespectful to treat it as not having yet quite established a\nsettled doctrine for the country.\n\nI have said in substance, that the Dred Scott decision was in part based\non assumed historical facts which were not really true, and I ought not\nto leave the subject without giving some reasons for saying this, I\ntherefore give an instance or two, which I think fully sustain me. Chief\nJustice Taney, in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court,\ninsists at great length that negroes were no part of the people who\nmade, or for whom was made, the Declaration of Independence, or the\nConstitution of the United States.\n\nOn the contrary, Judge Curtis, in his dissenting opinion, shows that in\nfive of the then thirteen States--to wit, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\nNew York, New Jersey, and North Carolina--free negroes were voters, and\nin proportion to their numbers had the same part in making the\nConstitution that the white people had. He shows this with so much\nparticularity as to leave no doubt of its truth; and as a sort of\nconclusion on that point, holds the following language:\n\n\"The Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the\nUnited States, through the action, in each State, of those persons\nwho were qualified by its laws to act thereon in behalf of\nthemselves and all other citizens of the State. In some of the\nStates, as we have seen, coloured persons were among those\nqualified by law to act on the subject. These coloured persons were\nnot only included in the body of 'the people of the United States'\nby whom the Constitution was ordained and established; but in at\nleast five of the States they had the power to act, and doubtless\ndid act, by their suffrages, upon the question of its adoption.\"\n\nAgain, Chief Justice Taney says:\n\n\"It is difficult at this day to realize the state of public\nopinion, in relation to that unfortunate race, which prevailed in\nthe civilized and enlightened portions of the world at the time of\nthe Declaration of Independence, and when the Constitution of the\nUnited States was framed and adopted.\"\n\nAnd again, after quoting from the Declaration, he says:\n\n\"The general words above quoted would seem to include the whole\nhuman family, and if they were used in a similar instrument at this\nday, would be so understood.\"\n\nIn these the Chief Justice does not directly assert, but plainly assumes\nas a fact, that the public estimate of the black man is more favourable\nnow than it was in the days of the Revolution. This assumption is a\nmistake. In some trifling particulars the condition of that race has\nbeen ameliorated; but as a whole, in this country, the change between\nthen and now is decidedly the other way; and their ultimate destiny has\nnever appeared so hopeless as in the last three or four years. In two\nof the five States--New Jersey and North Carolina--that then gave the\nfree negro the right of voting, the right has since been taken away; and\nin a third--New York--it has been greatly abridged: while it has not\nbeen extended, so far as I know, to a single additional State, though\nthe number of the States has more than doubled. In those days, as I\nunderstand, masters could, at their own pleasure, emancipate their\nslaves; but since then such legal restraints have been made upon\nemancipation as to amount almost to prohibition. In those days\nlegislatures held the unquestioned power to abolish slavery in their\nrespective States; but now it is becoming quite fashionable for State\nconstitutions to withhold that power from the legislatures. In those\ndays, by common consent, the spread of the black man's bondage to the\nnew countries was prohibited; but now Congress decides that it will not\ncontinue the prohibition, and the Supreme Court decides that it could\nnot if it would. In those days our Declaration of Independence was held\nsacred by all, and thought to include all; but now, to aid in making the\nbondage of the negro universal and eternal, it is assailed and sneered\nat, and construed, and hawked at, and torn, till, if its framers could\nrise from their graves, they could not at all recognize it. All the\npowers of earth seem rapidly combining against him. Mammon is after him;\nambition follows, philosophy follows, and the theology of the day is\nfast joining in the cry. They have him in his prison-house; they have\nsearched his person, and left no prying instrument with him. One after\nanother they have closed the heavy iron doors upon him; and now they\nhave him, as it were, bolted in with a lock of a hundred keys, which can\nnever be unlocked without the concurrence of every key; the keys in the\nhands of a hundred different men, and they scattered to a hundred\ndifferent and distant places; and they stand musing as to what\ninvention, in all the dominions of mind and matter, can be produced to\nmake the impossibility of escape more complete than it is. It is\ngrossly incorrect to say or assume that the public estimate of the negro\nis more favourable now than it was at the origin of the government.\n\n... There is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people\nat the idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black\nraces; and Judge Douglas evidently is basing his chief hope upon the\nchances of his being able to appropriate the benefit of this disgust to\nhimself. If he can, by much drumming and repeating, fasten the odium of\nthat idea upon his adversaries, he thinks he can struggle through the\nstorm. He therefore clings to this hope as a drowning man to the last\nplank. He makes an occasion for lugging it in from the opposition to the\nDred Scott decision. He finds the Republicans insisting that the\nDeclaration of Independence includes _all_ men, black as well as white;\nand forthwith he boldly denies that it includes negroes at all, and\nproceeds to argue gravely that all who contend it does, do so only\nbecause they want to vote, and eat, and sleep, and marry with negroes!\nHe will have it that they cannot be consistent else. Now I protest\nagainst the counterfeit logic which concludes that because I do not want\na black woman for a slave, I must necessarily want her for a wife. I\nneed not have her for either. I can just leave her alone. In some\nrespects she certainly is not my equal; but in her natural right to eat\nthe bread she earns with her own hands without asking leave of any one\nelse, she is my equal, and the equal of all others."

        "content": "Chief Justice Taney, in his opinion in the Dred Scott case, admits that\nthe language of the Declaration is broad enough to include the whole\nhuman family; but he and Judge Douglas argue that the authors of that\ninstrument did not intend to include negroes, by the fact that they did\nnot at once actually place them on an equality with the whites. Now this\ngrave argument comes to just nothing at all, by the other fact that they\ndid not at once, nor ever afterward, actually place all white people on\nan equality with one another. And this is the staple argument of both\nthe Chief Justice and the senator, for doing this obvious violence to\nthe plain, unmistakable language of the Declaration.\n\nI think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include _all_\nmen, but they did not intend to declare all men equal _in all respects_.\nThey did not mean to say that all were equal in colour, size, intellect,\nmoral developments, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable\ndistinctness in what respects they did consider all men created\nequal,--equal with \"certain inalienable rights, among which are life,\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" This they said, and this they\nmeant. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were\nthen actually enjoying that equality, nor yet that they were about to\nconfer it immediately upon them. In fact, they had no power to confer\nsuch a boon. They meant simply to declare the right, so that the\nenforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit.\n\nThey meant to set up a standard maxim for free society, which should be\nfamiliar to all and revered by all,--constantly looked to, constantly\nlaboured for, and, even though never perfectly attained, constantly\napproximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its\ninfluence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people\nof all colours everywhere. The assertion that \"all men are created\nequal,\" was of no practical use in effecting our separation from Great\nBritain; and it was placed in the Declaration, not for that, but for\nfuture use. Its authors meant it to be as, thank God, it is now proving\nitself, a stumbling-block to all those who in after times might seek to\nturn a free people back into the hateful paths of despotism. They knew\nthe proneness of prosperity to breed tyrants, and they meant, when such\nshould reappear in this fair land and commence their vocation, that they\nshould find left for them at least one hard nut to crack.\n\nI have now briefly expressed my view of the meaning and object of that\npart of the Declaration of Independence which declares that all men are\ncreated equal. Now let us hear Judge Douglas's view of the same\nsubject, as I find it in the printed report of his late speech. Here it\nis:\n\n\"No man can vindicate the character, motives and conduct of the\nsigners of the Declaration of Independence except upon the\nhypothesis that they referred to the white race alone, and not to\nthe African, when they declared all men to have been created equal;\nthat they were speaking of British subjects on this continent being\nequal to British subjects born and residing in Great Britain; that\nthey were entitled to the same inalienable rights, and among them\nwere enumerated life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The\nDeclaration was adopted for the purpose of justifying the colonists\nin the eyes of the civilized world in withdrawing their allegiance\nfrom the British crown, and dissolving their connection with the\nmother-country.\"\n\nMy good friends, read that carefully over some leisure hour, and ponder\nwell upon it; see what a mere wreck and mangled ruin Judge Douglas makes\nof our once glorious Declaration. He says \"they were speaking of British\nsubjects on this continent being equal to British subjects born and\nresiding in Great Britain!\" Why, according to this, not only negroes but\nwhite people outside of Great Britain and America were not spoken of in\nthat instrument. The English, Irish, and Scotch, along with white\nAmericans, were included, to be sure; but the French, Germans, and other\nwhite people of the world are all gone to pot along with the Judge's\ninferior races!\n\nI had thought that the Declaration promised something better than the\ncondition of British subjects; but no, it only meant that we should be\nequal to them in their own oppressed and unequal condition. According to\nthat, it gave no promise that, having kicked off the king and lords of\nGreat Britain, we should not at once be saddled with a king and lords of\nour own.\n\nI had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement\nin the condition of all men, everywhere; but no, it merely \"was adopted\nfor the purpose of justifying the colonists in the eyes of the\ncivilized world in withdrawing their allegiance from the British crown,\nand dissolving their connection with the mother-country.\" Why, that\nobject having been effected some eighty years ago, the Declaration is of\nno practical use now--mere rubbish--old wadding, left to rot on the\nbattle-field after the victory is won.\n\nI understand you are preparing to celebrate the \"Fourth,\" to-morrow\nweek. What for? The doings of that day had no reference to the present;\nand quite half of you are not even descendants of those who were\nreferred to at that day. But I suppose you will celebrate, and will even\ngo so far as to read the Declaration. Suppose, after you read it once in\nthe old-fashioned way, you read it once more with Judge Douglas's\nversion. It will then run thus: \"We told these truths to be\nself-evident, that all British subjects who were on this continent\neighty-one years ago, were created equal to all British subjects born\nand then residing in Great Britain!\"\n\n... The very Dred Scott case affords a strong test as to which party\nmost favours amalgamation, the Republicans or the dear Union-saving\nDemocracy. Dred Scott, his wife and two daughters, were all involved in\nthe suit. We desired the court to have held that they were citizens, so\nfar at least as to entitle them to a hearing as to whether they were\nfree or not; and then also, that they were in fact and in law really\nfree. Could we have had our way, the chances of these black girls ever\nmixing their blood with that of white people would have been diminished\nat least to the extent that it could not have been without their\nconsent. But Judge Douglas is delighted to have them decided to be\nslaves, and not human enough to have a hearing, even if they were free,\nand thus left subject to the forced concubinage of their masters, and\nliable to become the mothers of mulattoes in spite of themselves,--the\nvery state of the case that produces nine-tenths of all the mulattoes,\nall the mixing of the blood of the nation.\n\n_\"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\" On Lincoln's Nomination\nto the United States Senate. Springfield, Illinois. June 17, 1858_\n\nIf we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we\ncould better judge what to do, and how to do it. We are now far into the\nfifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and\nconfident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation. Under the\noperation of that policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but\nhas constantly augmented. In my opinion it will not cease until a crisis\nshall have been reached and passed. \"A house divided against itself\ncannot stand.\" I believe this government cannot endure permanently, half\nslave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved,--I do\nnot expect the house to fall; but I do expect it will cease to be\ndivided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the\nopponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it\nwhere the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course\nof ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it forward till it\nshall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North\nas well as South."

        "content": "_Becquerel Rays._—The uranium rays discovered by M. Becquerel act upon\nphotographic plates screened from the light; they can penetrate all\nsolid, liquid, and gaseous substances, provided that the thickness is\nsufficiently reduced; in passing through a gas, they cause it to become\na feeble conductor of electricity.\n\nThese properties of the uranium compounds are not due to any known\ncause. The radiation seems to be spontaneous; it loses nothing in\nintensity, even on keeping the compounds in complete darkness for\nseveral years; hence there is no question of the phosphorescence being\nspecially produced by light.\n\nThe spontaneity and persistence of the uranium radiation appear as a\nquite unique physical phenomenon. M. Becquerel kept a piece of uranium\nfor several years in the dark, and he has affirmed that at the end of\nthis time the action upon a photographic plate had not sensibly altered.\nMM. Elster and Geitel made a similar experiment, and also found the\naction to remain constant.\n\nI measured the intensity of radiation of uranium by the effect of this\nradiation on the conductivity of air. The method of measurement will be\nexplained later. I also obtained figures which prove the persistence of\nradiation within the limits of accuracy of the experiments.\n\nFor these measurements a metallic plate was used covered with a layer of\npowdered uranium; this plate was not otherwise kept in the dark; this\nprecaution, according to the experimenters already quoted, being of no\nimportance. The number of measurements taken with this plate is very\ngreat, and they actually extend over a period of five years.\n\nSome researches were conducted to discover whether other substances were\ncapable of acting similarly to the uranium compounds. M. Schmidt was the\nfirst to publish that thorium and its compounds possess exactly the same\nproperty. A similar research, made contemporaneously, gave me the same\nresult. I published this not knowing at the time of Schmidt’s\npublication.\n\nWe shall say that uranium, thorium, and their compounds emit _Becquerel\nrays_. I have called _radio-active_ those substances which generate\nemissions of this nature. This name has since been adopted generally.\n\nIn their photographic and electric effects, the Becquerel rays\napproximate to the Röntgen rays. They also, like the latter, possess the\nfaculty of penetrating all matter. But their capacity for penetration is\nvery different; the rays of uranium and of thorium are arrested by some\nmillimetres of solid matter, and cannot traverse in air a distance\ngreater than a few centimetres; this at least is the case for the\ngreater part of the radiation.\n\nThe researches of different physicists, and primarily of Mr. Rutherford,\nhave shown that the Becquerel rays undergo neither regular reflection,\nnor refraction, nor polarisation.\n\nThe feeble penetrating power of uranium and thorium rays would point to\ntheir similarity to the secondary rays produced by the Röntgen rays, and\nwhich have been investigated by M. Sagnac, rather than to the Röntgen\nrays themselves.\n\nFor the rest, the Becquerel rays might be classified as cathode rays\npropagated in the air. It is now known that these different analogies\nare all legitimate.\n\n_Measurement of the Intensity of Radiation._\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\n\nThe method employed consists in measuring the conductivity acquired by\nair under the action of radio-active bodies; this method possesses the\nadvantage of being rapid and of furnishing figures which are comparable.\nThe apparatus employed by me for the purpose consists essentially of a\nplate condenser, A B (Fig. 1). The active body, finely powered, is\nspread over the plate B, making the air between the plates a conductor.\nIn order to measure the conductivity, the plate B is raised to a high\npotential by connecting it with one pole of a battery of small\naccumulators, P, of which the other pole is connected to earth. The\nplate A being maintained at the potential of the earth by the connection\nC D, an electric current is set up between the two plates. The potential\nof plate A is recorded by an electrometer, E. If the earth connection be\nbroken at C, the plate A becomes charged, and this charge causes a\ndeflection of the electrometer. The velocity of the deflection is\nproportional to the intensity of the current, and serves to measure the\nlatter.\n\nBut a preferable method of measurement is that of compensating the\ncharge on plate A, so as to cause no deflection of the electrometer. The\ncharges in question are extremely weak; they may be compensated by means\nof a quartz electric balance, Q, one sheath of which is connected to\nplate A and the other to earth. The quartz lamina is subjected to a\nknown tension, produced by placing weights in a plate, π; the tension is\nproduced progressively, and has the effect of generating progressively a\nknown quantity of electricity during the time observed. The operation\ncan be so regulated that, at each instant, there is compensation between\nthe quantity of electricity that traverses the condenser and that of the\nopposite kind furnished by the quartz. In this way, the quantity of\nelectricity passing through the condenser for a given time, _i.e._, the\n_intensity of the current_, can be measured _in absolute units_. The\nmeasurement is independent of the sensitiveness of the electrometer.\n\nIn carrying out a certain number of measurements of this kind, it is\nseen that radio-activity is a phenomenon capable of being measured with\na certain accuracy. It varies little with temperature; it is scarcely\naffected by variations in the temperature of the surroundings; it is not\ninfluenced by incandescence of the active substance. The intensity of\nthe current which traverses the condenser increases with the surface of\nthe plates. For a given condenser and a given substance the current\nincreases with the difference of potential between the plates, with the\npressure of the gas which fills the condenser, and with the distance of\nthe plates (provided this distance be not too great in comparison with\nthe diameter). In every case, for great differences of potential the\ncurrent attains a limiting value, which is practically constant. This is\nthe _current of saturation_, or _limiting current_. Similarly, for a\ncertain sufficiently great distance between the plates the current\nhardly varies any longer with the distance. It is the current obtained\nunder these conditions that was taken as the measure of radio-activity\nin my researches, the condenser being placed in air at atmospheric\npressure.\n\nI append curves which represent the intensity of the current as a\nfunction of the field established between the plates for two different\nplate distances. Plate B was covered with a thin layer of powdered\nmetallic uranium; plate A, connected with the electrometer, was provided\nwith a guard-ring.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\n\nFig. 2 shows that the intensity of the current becomes constant for high\npotential differences between the plates. Fig. 3 represents the same\ncurves on another scale, and comprehends only relative results for small\ndifferences of potential. At the origin, the curve is rectilinear; the\nratio of the intensity of the current to the difference of potential is\nconstant for weak forces, and represents the initial conduction between\nthe plates. Two important characteristic constants of the observed\nphenomenon are therefore to be recognised:—(1) The _initial conduction_\nfor small differences of potential; (2) the _limiting current_ for great\npotential differences. The limiting current has been adopted as the\nmeasure of the radio-activity."

        "content": "Besides the difference of potential established between the two plates,\nthere exists between them an electromotive force of contact, and these\ntwo sources of current combine their effects; for this reason, the\nabsolute value of the intensity of the current changes with the sign of\nthe external difference of potential. In every case, for considerable\npotential differences, the effect of the electromotive force of contact\nis negligible, and the intensity of the current is therefore the same\nwhatever be the direction of the field between the plates.\n\nThe investigation of the conductivity of air and other gases subjected\nto the action of Becquerel rays has been undertaken by several\nphysicists. A very complete research upon the subject has been published\nby Mr. Rutherford.\n\nThe laws of the conductivity produced in gases by the Becquerel rays are\nthe same as those found for the Röntgen rays. The mechanics of the\nphenomenon appear to be the same in both cases. The theory of ionisation\nof the gases by the action of the Röntgen or Becquerel rays agrees well\nwith the observed facts. This theory will not be put forward here. I\nwill merely record the results to which they point:—\n\nFirstly, the number of ions produced per second in the gas is considered\nproportional to the energy of radiation absorbed by the gas.\n\nSecondly, in order to obtain the limiting current relatively to a given\nradiation, it is necessary, on the one hand, to cause complete\nabsorption of this radiation by the gas by employing a sufficient mass\nof it; on the other hand, it is necessary for the production of the\ncurrent to use all the ions generated by establishing an electric field\nof such strength that the number of the ions which recombine may be a\nnegligible fraction of the total number of ions produced in the same\ntime, most of which are carried by the current to the electrodes. The\nstrength of the electric field necessary to give this result is\nproportional to the amount of ionisation.\n\nAccording to the recent researches of Mr. Townsend, the phenomenon is\nmore complex when the pressure of the gas is low. At first the current\nappears to approach to a constant limiting value with increasing\ndifference of potential; but after a certain point has been reached, the\ncurrent begins again to increase with the field, and with very great\nrapidity. Mr. Townsend ascribes this increase to a new ionisation\nproduced by the ions themselves when, under the action of the electric\nfield, they acquire a velocity such that a molecule of gas encountering\none of them becomes broken down into its constituent ions. A strong\nelectric field and a low pressure are favourable to the production of\nthis ionisation by ions already present, and, as soon as the action is\nset up, the intensity of the current increases uniformly with the field\nbetween the plates. The limiting current could, therefore, only be\nobtained under conditions of ionisation of which the intensity does not\nexceed a certain value, and in such a manner that saturation corresponds\nto fields in which, from multiplicity of ions, ionisation can no longer\ntake place. This condition has occurred in my experiments.\n\nThe order of magnitude of the saturation currents obtained with uranium\ncompounds is 10^{–11} ampères for a condenser in which the plates have a\ndiameter of 8 c.m., and are at a distance of 3 c.m. Thorium compounds\ngive rise to currents of the same order of magnitude, and the activity\nof the oxides of uranium and thorium is very similar.\n\n_Radio-activity of the Compounds of Uranium and Thorium._\n\nThe following are the figures I obtained with different uranium\ncompounds. I have represented the intensity of the current in ampères by\nthe letter _i_:—\n\n_i_ × 10^{11}.\n\nMetallic uranium (containing a little carbon)            2·3\nBlack oxide of uranium, U_{2}O_{5}                       2·6\nGreen oxide of uranium, U_{3}O_{4}                       1·8\nHydrated uranic acid                                     0·6\nUranate of sodium                                        1·2\nUranate of potassium                                     1·2\nUranate of ammonium                                      1·3\nUranium sulphate                                         0·7\nSulphate of uranium and potassium                        0·7\nNitrate of uranium                                       0·7\nPhosphate of copper and uranium                          0·9\nOxysulphide of uranium                                   1·2\n\nThe thickness of the layer of the uranium compound used has little\neffect, provided that the layer is uniform. The following illustrate\nthis point:—\n\nThickness of layer.     _i_ × 10^{11}.\nM.m.\nUranium oxide                0·5                  2·7\nUranium oxide                3·0                  3·0\nAmmonium uranate             0·5                  1·3\nAmmonium uranate             3·0                  1·4\n\nIt may be concluded from this that the absorption of uranium rays by the\nsubstance which generates them is very great, since the rays proceeding\nfrom deep layers produce no significant effect.\n\nThe figures I obtained with thorium compounds enable me to state:—\n\nFirstly, that the thickness of the layer used has considerable effect,\nespecially in the case of the oxide.\n\nSecondly, that the action is only regular if a sufficiently thin layer\nis used (_e.g._, 0·25 m.m.). On the contrary, when a thick layer of the\nsubstance is used (6 m.m.), the figures obtained vary between two\nextreme limits, especially in the case of the oxide:—\n\nThickness of layer.     _i_ × 10^{11}.\nM.m.\nThorium oxide    0·25                        2·2\nThorium oxide    0·5                         2·5\nThorium oxide    2·5                         4·7\nThorium oxide    3·0                         5·5 (mean)\nThorium oxide    6·0                         5·5 (mean)\nThorium sulphate 0·25                        0·8 (mean)\n\nThere is here some cause of irregularities which do not exist in the\ncase of the uranium compounds.

        "content": "The characteristics of the thorium radiation have formed the subject of\nvery complete publications. Mr. Owens has demonstrated that a uniform\ncurrent is only obtained after some time has elapsed, with an enclosed\napparatus, and that the intensity of the current is greatly reduced\nunder the influence of a current of air (which does not occur with the\ncompounds of uranium). Mr. Rutherford has made similar experiments, and\nhas explained them by the proposition that thorium and its compounds\nproduce, besides the Becquerel rays, another _emanation_, composed of\nextremely minute particles, which remain radio-active for some time\nafter their emission, and are capable of being swept along by a current\nof air.\n\nThe characteristics of the thorium radiation, which have reference to\nthe thickness of the layer employed and to the action of air currents,\nhave an intimate connection with the phenomenon of the _radio-activity\ninduced, and of its propagation from place to place_. This phenomenon\nwas observed for the first time with radium, and will be described\nlater.\n\nThe radio-activity of thorium and uranium compounds appears as an\n_atomic property_. M. Becquerel has already observed that all uranium\ncompounds are active, and had concluded that their activity was due to\nthe presence of the element uranium; he also demonstrated that uranium\nwas more active than its salts. I have investigated, from this point of\nview, the compounds of thorium and uranium, and have taken a great many\nmeasurements of their activity under different conditions. The result of\nall these determinations shows the radio-activity of these substances to\nbe decidedly an atomic property. It seems to depend upon the presence of\natoms of the two elements in question, and is not influenced by any\nchange of physical state or chemical decomposition. The chemical\ncombinations and mixtures containing uranium or thorium are active in\nproportion to the amount of the metal contained, all inactive material\nacting as inert bodies and absorbing the radiation.\n\n_Is Atomic Radio-activity a general Phenomenon?_\n\nAs I have said above, I made experiments to discover whether substances\nother than compounds of uranium and thorium were radio-active. I\nundertook this research with the idea that it was scarcely probable that\nradio-activity, considered as an atomic property, should belong to a\ncertain kind of matter to the exclusion of all other. The determinations\nI made permit me to say that, for chemical elements actually considered\nas such, including the rarest and most hypothetical, the compounds I\ninvestigated were always at least 100 times less active in my apparatus\nthan metallic uranium.\n\nThe following is a summary of the substances experimented upon, either\nas the element or in combination:—\n\n1. All the metals or non-metals easily procurable, and some, more rare,\npure products obtained from the collection of M. Etard, at the Ecole de\nPhysique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris.\n\n2. The following rare bodies:—Gallium, germanium, neodymium,\npraseodymium, niobium, scandium, gadolinium, erbium, samarium, and\nrubidium (specimens lent by M. Demarçay), yttrium, ytterbium (lent by M.\nUrbain).\n\n3. A large number of rocks and minerals.\n\nWithin the limits of sensitiveness of any apparatus, I found no simple\nsubstance, other than uranium and thorium, possessing atomic\nradio-activity. It will be suitable to add a few words here concerning\nphosphorus. White moist phosphorus, placed between the plates of the\ncondenser, causes the air between the plates to conduct. However, I do\nnot consider this body radio-active in the same manner as thorium and\nuranium. For, under these conditions, phosphorus becomes oxidised and\nemits luminous rays, whilst uranium and thorium compounds are\nradio-active without showing any chemical change which can be detected\nby any known means. Further, phosphorus is not active in the red\nvariety, nor in a state of combination.\n\nIn a recent work, M. Bloch has demonstrated that phosphorus, undergoing\noxidation in air, gives rise to slightly motile ions, which make the air\nconduct, and cause condensation of aqueous vapour.\n\nUranium and thorium are elements which possess the highest atomic\nweights (240 and 232); they occur frequently in the same minerals.\n\n_Radio-active Minerals._\n\nI have examined many minerals in my apparatus; certain of them gave\nevidence of radio-activity, _e.g._, pitchblende, thorite, orangite,\nfergusonite, cleveite, chalcolite, autunite, monazite, &c. The following\nis a table giving in ampères the intensity, _i_, of the current obtained\nwith metallic uranium and with different minerals:—\n\n│_i_ × 10^{11}.\nUranium                            │2·3\nPitchblende from Johanngeorgenstadt│8·3\nPitchblende from Joachimsthal      │7·0\nPitchblende from Pzibran           │6·5\nPitchblende from Cornwallis        │1·6\nCleveite                           │1·4\nChalcolite                         │5·2\nAutunite                           │2·7\n───────────────────────────────────┼──────────────\nVarious thorites                   │0·1\n〃                 │0·3\n〃                 │0·7\n〃                 │1·3\n〃                 │1·4\n───────────────────────────────────┼──────────────\nOrangite                           │2·0\nMonazite                           │0·5\nXenotime                           │0·03\nÆschynite                          │0·7\n───────────────────────────────────┼──────────────\nFergusonite (two samples)          │0·4\n〃                 │0·1\n───────────────────────────────────┼──────────────\nSamarskite                         │1·1\n───────────────────────────────────┼──────────────\nNiobite (two samples)              │0·1\n〃                 │0·3\n───────────────────────────────────┼──────────────\nTantalite                          │0·02\nCarnotite                          │6·2\n\nThe current obtained with orangite (native oxide of thorium) varied\ngreatly with the thickness of the layer. By increasing this thickness\nfrom 0·25 m.m. to 6 m.m. the current increased from 1·8 to 2·3.\n\nAll the minerals which showed radio-activity contained uranium or\nthorium: their activity is therefore not surprising, but the intensity\nof the action in certain cases is unexpected. Thus pitchblendes (ores of\nuranium oxide) are found which are four times as active as metallic\nuranium. Chalcolite (double phosphate of copper and uranium) is twice as\nactive as uranium. Autunite (phosphate of uranium and calcium) is as\nactive as uranium. These facts do not accord with previous conclusions,\naccording to which no mineral should be so active as thorium or uranium.\n\nTo throw light on this point, I prepared artificial chalcolite by the\nprocess of Debray, starting with the pure products. The process consists\nin mixing a solution of uranium nitrate with a solution of copper\nphosphate in phosphoric acid and warming to 50° or 60°. After some time,\ncrystals of chalcolite appear in the liquid.\n\nChalcolite thus obtained possesses a perfectly normal activity, given by\nits composition; it is two and a-half times less active than uranium.\n\nIt therefore appeared probable that if pitchblende, chalcolite, and\nautunite possess so great a degree of activity, these substances contain\na small quantity of a strongly radio-active body, differing from uranium\nand thorium and the simple bodies actually known. I thought that if this\nwere indeed the case, I might hope to extract this substance from the\nore by the ordinary methods of chemical analysis."

        "content": "The results of the investigation of radio-active minerals, announced in\nthe preceding chapter, led M. Curie and myself to endeavour to extract a\nnew radio-active body from pitchblende. Our method of procedure could\nonly be based on radio-activity, as we know of no other property of the\nhypothetical substance. The following is the method pursued for a\nresearch based on radio-activity:—The radio-activity of a compound is\ndetermined, and a chemical decomposition of this compound is effected;\nthe radio-activity of all the products obtained is determined, having\nregard to the proportion in which the radio-active substance is\ndistributed among them. In this way, an indication is obtained, which\nmay to a certain extent be compared to that which spectrum analysis\nfurnishes. In order to obtain comparable figures, the activity of the\nsubstances must be determined in the solid form well dried.\n\n_Polonium, Radium, Actinium._\n\nThe analysis of pitchblende with the help of the method just explained,\nled us to the discovery in this mineral of two strongly radio-active\nsubstances, chemically dissimilar:—Polonium, discovered by ourselves,\nand radium, which we discovered in conjunction with M. Bémont.\n\n_Polonium_ from the analytical point of view, is analogous to bismuth,\nand separates out with the latter. By one of the following methods of\nfractionating, bismuth products are obtained increasingly rich in\npolonium:—\n\n1. Sublimation of the sulphides _in vacuo_; the active sulphide is much\nmore volatile than bismuth sulphide.\n\n2. Precipitation of solutions of the nitrate by water; the precipitate\nof the basic nitrate is much more active than the salt which remains in\nsolution.\n\n3. Precipitation by sulphuretted hydrogen of a hydrochloric acid\nsolution, strongly acid; the precipitated sulphides are considerably\nmore active than the salt which remains in solution.\n\n_Radium_ is a substance which accompanies the barium obtained from\npitchblende; it resembles barium in its reactions, and is separated from\nit by difference of solubility of the chlorides in water, in dilute\nalcohol, or in water acidified with hydrochloric acid. We effect the\nseparation of the chlorides of barium and radium by subjecting the\nmixture to fractional crystallisation, radium chloride being less\nsoluble than that of barium.\n\nA third strongly radio-active body has been identified in pitchblende by\nM. Debierne, who gave it the name of _actinium_. Actinium accompanies\ncertain members of the iron group contained in pitchblende; it appears\nin particular allied to thorium, from which it has not yet been found\npossible to separate it. The extraction of actinium from pitchblende is\na very difficult operation, the separations being as a rule incomplete.\n\nAll three of the new radio-active bodies occur in quite infinitesimal\namount in pitchblende. In order to obtain them in a more concentrated\ncondition, we were obliged to treat several tons of residue of the ore\nof uranium. The rough treatment was carried out in the factory; and this\nwas followed by processes of purification and concentration. We thus\nsucceeded in extracting from thousands of kilogrms. of crude material a\nfew decigrammes of products which were exceedingly active as compared\nwith the ore from which they were obtained. It is obvious that this\nprocess is long, arduous, and costly.\n\nOther new radio-active bodies have been notified since the termination\nof our work. M. Giesel, on the one hand, and MM. Hoffmann and Strauss on\nthe other, have announced the probable existence of a radio-active body\nsimilar to lead in its chemical properties. At present only a few\nsamples of this substance have been obtained.\n\nRadium is, so far, the only member of the new radio-active substances\nthat has been isolated as the pure salt.\n\n_Spectrum of Radium._\n\nIt was of the first importance to check, by all possible means, the\nhypothesis, underlying this work, of new radio-active elements. In the\ncase of radium, spectrum analysis was the means of confirming this\nhypothesis.\n\nM. Demarçay undertook the examination of the new radio-active bodies by\nthe searching methods which he employs in the study of photographic\nspark spectra.\n\nThe assistance of so competent a scientist was of the greatest value to\nus, and we are deeply grateful to him for having consented to take up\nthis work. The results of the spectrum analysis brought conviction to us\nwhen we were still in doubt as to the interpretation of the results of\nour research.\n\nThe first specimens of fairly active barium chloride containing radium,\nexamined by M. Demarçay, exhibited together with the barium lines a new\nline of considerable intensity and of wave-length λ = 381·47 µµ in the\nultra-violet. With the more active products prepared subsequently,\nDemarçay saw the line 381·47 µµ more distinctly; at the same time other\nnew lines appeared, and the intensity of the new lines was comparable\nwith that of the barium lines. A further concentration furnished a\nproduct for which the new spectrum predominated, and the three strongest\nbarium lines, alone visible, merely indicated the presence of this metal\nas an impurity. This product may be looked upon as nearly pure radium\nchloride. Finally, by further purification, I obtained an exceedingly\npure chloride, in the spectrum of which the two chief barium lines were\nscarcely visible.\n\nThe following is a list, according to Demarçay, of the principal radium\nlines for the portion of the spectrum included between λ = 500·0 and λ =\n350·0 µµ. The intensity of each line is represented by a figure, the\nstrongest being marked 16:—\n\nλ.   Intensity.\n482·63         10\n472·69          5\n469·98          3\n469·21          7\n468·30         14\n464·19          4\n460·03          3\n453·35          9\n443·61          8\n434·06         12\n381·47         16\n364·96         12\n\nAll the lines are clear and narrow, the three lines 381·47, 468·30,\n434·06 are strong, and equal the most intense of those actually known.\nTwo well-marked misty bands are also visible in the spectrum. The first,\nwhich is symmetrical, extends from 463·10 to 462·19, with a maximum at\n462·75. The second, which is stronger, fades towards the ultra-violet;\nit begins, sharply defined, at 446·37, and passes through a maximum at\n445·52; the region of the maximum extends as far as 445·34, then a\nnebulous band, gradually fading, extends about as far as 439.\n\nIn the least refrangible part, not photographed in the spark spectrum,\nthe only significant line is 566·5 (approx.), much more feeble, however,\nthan 482·63.\n\nThe general aspect of the spectrum is that of the metals of the alkaline\nearths; these metals are known to have well-marked line spectra with\ncertain nebulous bands.\n\nAccording to Demarçay, the position of radium may be among the bodies\npossessing the most sensitive spectrum reaction. I also have concluded\nfrom the work of concentration, that in the first specimen examined,\nwhich showed clearly the line 3814·7, the proportion of radium must have\nbeen very small (perhaps about 0·02 per cent). Nevertheless, an activity\nfifty times as great as that of metallic uranium is required in order to\ndistinguish clearly the principal radium line in the spectra\nphotographed. With a sensitive electrometer the radio-activity of a\nsubstance only 1/100 of that of metallic uranium can be detected. It is\nclear that, in order to detect the presence of radium, the property of\nradio-activity is several thousand times more sensitive than the\nspectrum reaction.\n\nBismuth containing polonium and thorium containing actinium, both very\nactive, examined by Demarçay, have so far each only yielded bismuth and\nthorium lines.\n\nIn a recent publication, M. Giesel, who is occupied in preparing radium,\nstates that radium bromide gives a carmine flame colouration. The flame\nspectrum of radium contains two beautiful red bands, one line in the\nblue-green, and two faint lines in the violet.\n\n_Extraction of the New Radio-active Substances._"

        "content": "The first stage of the operation consists in extracting barium with\nradium from the ores of uranium, also bismuth with polonium and the rare\nearths containing actinium from the same. These three primary products\nhaving been obtained, the next step is in each case to endeavour to\nisolate the new radio-active body. This second part of the treatment\nconsists of a process of fractionation. The difficulty of finding a very\nperfect means of separating closely allied elements is well known;\nmethods of fractionation are therefore quite suitable. Besides this,\nwhen a mere trace of one element is mixed with another element, no\nmethod of complete separation could be applied to the mixture, even\nallowing that such a method was known; in fact, one would run the risk\nof losing the trace of the material to be separated.\n\nThe particular object of my work has been the isolation of radium and\npolonium. After working for several years, I have so far only succeeded\nin obtaining the former.\n\nPitchblende is an expensive ore, and we have given up the treatment of\nit in large quantities. In Europe the extraction of this ore is carried\nout in the mine of Joachimsthal, in Bohemia. The crushed ore is roasted\nwith carbonate of soda, and the resulting material washed, first with\nwarm water and then with dilute sulphuric acid. The solution contains\nthe uranium, which gives pitchblende its value. The insoluble residue is\nrejected. This residue contains radio-active substances; its activity is\nfour and a-half times that of metallic uranium. The Austrian Government,\nto whom the mine belongs, presented us with a ton of this residue for\nour research, and authorised the mine to give us several tons more of\nthe material.\n\nIt was not very easy to apply the methods of the laboratory to the\npreliminary treatment of the residue in the factory. M. Debierne\ninvestigated this question, and organised the treatment in the factory.\nThe most important point of his method is the conversion of the\nsulphates into carbonate by boiling the material with a concentrated\nsolution of sodium carbonate. This method avoids the necessity of fusing\nwith sodium carbonate.\n\nThe residue chiefly contains the sulphates of lead and calcium, silica,\nalumina, and iron oxide. In addition nearly all the metals are found in\ngreater or smaller amount (copper, bismuth, zinc, cobalt, manganese,\nnickel, vanadium, antimony, thallium, rare earths, niobium, tantalum,\narsenic, barium, &c.). Radium is found in this mixture as sulphate, and\nis the least soluble sulphate in it. In order to dissolve it, it is\nnecessary to remove the sulphuric acid as far as possible. To do this,\nthe residue is first treated with a boiling concentrated soda solution.\nThe sulphuric acid combined with the lead, aluminium, and calcium\npasses, for the most part, into solution as sulphate of sodium, which is\nremoved by repeatedly washing with water. The alkaline solution removes\nat the same time lead, silicon, and aluminium. The insoluble portion is\nattacked by ordinary hydrochloric acid. This operation completely\ndisintegrates the material, and dissolves most of it. Polonium and\nactinium may be obtained from this solution; the former is precipitated\nby sulphuretted hydrogen, the latter is found in the hydrates\nprecipitated by ammonia in the solution separated from the sulphides and\noxidised. Radium remains in the insoluble portion. This portion is\nwashed with water, and then treated with a boiling concentrated solution\nof carbonate of soda. This operation completes the transformation of the\nsulphates of barium and radium into carbonates. The material is then\nthoroughly washed with water, and then treated with dilute hydrochloric\nacid, quite free from sulphuric acid. The solution contains radium as\nwell as polonium and actinium. It is filtered and precipitated with\nsulphuric acid. In this way the crude sulphates of barium containing\nradium and calcium, of lead, and of iron, and of a trace of actinium are\nobtained. The solution still contains a little actinium and polonium,\nwhich may be separated out as in the case of the first hydrochloric acid\nsolution.\n\nFrom one ton of residue 10 to 20 kilogrms. of crude sulphates are\nobtained, the activity of which is from thirty to sixty times as great\nas that of metallic uranium. They must now be purified. For this purpose\nthey are boiled with sodium carbonate and transformed into the\nchlorides. The solution is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, which\ngives a small quantity of active sulphides containing polonium. The\nsolution is filtered, oxidised by means of chlorine, and precipitated\nwith pure ammonia. The precipitated hydrates and oxides are very active,\nand the activity is due to actinium. The filtered solution is\nprecipitated with sodium carbonate. The precipitated carbonates of the\nalkaline earths are washed and converted into chlorides. These chlorides\nare evaporated to dryness, and washed with pure concentrated\nhydrochloric acid. Calcium chloride dissolves almost entirely, whilst\nthe chloride of barium and radium remains insoluble. Thus, from one ton\nof the original material about 8 kilogrms. of barium and radium chloride\nare obtained, of which the activity is about sixty times that of\nmetallic uranium. The chloride is now ready for fractionation.\n\n_Polonium._\n\nAs I said above, by passing sulphuretted hydrogen through the various\nhydrochloric acid solutions obtained during the course of the process,\nactive sulphides are precipitated, of which the activity is due to\npolonium. These sulphides chiefly contain bismuth, a little copper and\nlead; the latter metal occurs in relatively small amount, because it has\nbeen to a great extent removed by the soda solution, and because its\nchloride is only slightly soluble. Antimony and arsenic are found among\nthe oxides only in the minutest quantity, their oxides having been\ndissolved by the soda. In order to obtain the very active sulphides, the\nfollowing process was employed:—The solutions made strongly acid with\nhydrochloric acid were precipitated with sulphuretted hydrogen; the\nsulphides thus precipitated are very active, and are employed for the\npreparation of polonium; there remain in the solution substances not\ncompletely precipitated in presence of excess of hydrochloric acid\n(bismuth, lead, antimony). To complete the precipitation, the solution\nis diluted with water, and treated again with sulphuretted hydrogen,\nwhich gives a second precipitate of sulphides, much less active than the\nfirst, and which have generally been rejected. For the further\npurification of the sulphides, they are washed with ammonium sulphide,\nwhich removes the last remaining traces of antimony and arsenic. They\nare then washed with water and ammonium nitrate, and treated with dilute\nnitric acid. Complete solution never occurs; there is always an\ninsoluble residue, more or less considerable, which can be treated\nafresh if it is judged expedient. The solution is reduced to a small\nvolume and precipitated either by ammonia or by excess of water. In both\ncases the lead and the copper remain in solution; in the second case, a\nlittle bismuth, scarcely active at all, remains also in solution.\n\nThe precipitate of oxides or basic nitrates is subjected to\nfractionation in the following manner:—The precipitate is dissolved in\nnitric acid, and water is added to the solution until a sufficient\nquantity of precipitate is formed; it must be borne in mind that\nsometimes the precipitate does not at once appear. The precipitate is\nseparated from the supernatant liquid, and re-dissolved in nitric acid,\nafter which both the liquids thus obtained are re-precipitated with\nwater, and treated as before. The different fractions are combined\naccording to their activity, and concentration is carried out as far as\npossible. In this way is obtained a very small quantity of a substance\nof which the activity is very high, but which, nevertheless, has so far\nonly shown bismuth lines in the spectroscope."

        "content": "There is, unfortunately, little chance of obtaining the isolation of\npolonium by this means. The method of fractionation just described\npresents many difficulties, and the case is similar with other wet\nprocesses of fractionation. Whatever be the method employed, compounds\nare readily formed which are absolutely insoluble in dilute or\nconcentrated acids. These compounds can only be re-dissolved by reducing\nthem to the metallic state, _e.g._, by fusion with potassium cyanide.\nConsidering the number of operations necessary, this circumstance\nconstitutes an enormous difficulty in the progress of the fractionation.\nThis obstacle is the greater because polonium, once extracted from the\npitchblende, diminishes in activity. This diminution of activity is\nslow, for a specimen of bismuth nitrate containing polonium only lost\nhalf its activity in eleven months.\n\nNo such difficulty occurs with radium. The radio-activity remains\nthroughout an accurate gauge of the concentration; the concentration\nitself presents no difficulty, and the progress of the work from the\nstart can be constantly checked by spectral analysis.\n\nWhen the phenomena of induced radio-activity, which will be discussed\nlater on, were made known, it seemed obvious that polonium, which only\nshows the bismuth lines and whose activity diminishes with time, was not\na new element, but bismuth made active by the vicinity of radium in the\npitchblende. I am not sure that this opinion is correct. In the course\nof my prolonged work on polonium, I have noted chemical effects, which I\nhave never observed either with ordinary bismuth or with bismuth made\nactive by radium. These chemical effects are, in the first place, the\nextremely ready formation of insoluble compounds, of which I have spoken\nabove (especially basic nitrates), and, in the second place, the colour\nand appearance of the precipitates obtained by adding water to the\nnitric acid solution of bismuth containing polonium. These precipitates\nare sometimes white, but more generally of a more or less vivid yellow,\nverging on red.\n\nThe absence of lines other than those of bismuth does not necessarily\nprove that the substance only contains bismuth, because bodies exist\nwhose spectrum reaction is scarcely visible.\n\nIt would be necessary to prepare a small quantity of bismuth containing\npolonium in as concentrated a condition as possible, and to examine it\nchemically, in the first place determining the atomic weight of the\nmetal. It has not yet been possible to carry out this research on\naccount of the difficulties of a chemical nature already mentioned.\n\nIf polonium were proved to be a new element, it would be no less true\nthat it cannot exist indefinitely in a strongly radio-active condition,\nat least when extracted from the ore. There are therefore two aspects of\nthe question:—First, whether the activity of polonium is entirely\ninduced by the proximity of substances themselves radio-active, in which\ncase polonium would possess the faculty of acquiring atomic activity\npermanently, a faculty which does not appear to belong to any substance\nwhatever; second, whether the activity of polonium is an inherent\nproperty, which is spontaneously destroyed under certain conditions, and\npersists under certain other conditions, such as those which exist in\nthe ore. The phenomenon of atomic activity induced by contact is still\nso little understood, that we lack the ground on which to formulate any\nopinion on the matter.\n\n(NOTE.—A work has recently appeared on polonium by M. Marckwald. He\nplunges a small rod of pure bismuth into a hydrochloric acid solution of\nthe bismuth extracted from the pitchblende residue. After some time the\nrod becomes coated with a very active deposit, and the solution now\ncontains only inactive bismuth. M. Marckwald also obtains a very active\ndeposit by adding tin chloride to a hydrochloric acid solution of\nradio-active bismuth. From this he concludes that the active element is\nallied to tellurium, and gives it the name of _radiotellurium_. This\nactive substance of M. Marckwald seems identical with polonium, from its\nbehaviour, and from the easily absorbed rays it emits. The choice of a\nnew name for this substance is futile in the present state of the\nquestion).\n\n_Preparation of the Pure Chloride of Radium._\n\nThe method by which I extracted pure radium chloride from barium\nchloride containing radium consists in first subjecting the mixture of\nthe chlorides to fractional crystallisation in pure water, then in water\nto which hydrochloric acid has been added. The difference in solubility\nof the two chlorides is thus made use of, that of radium being less\nsoluble than that of barium.\n\nAt the beginning of the fractionation, pure distilled water is used. The\nchloride is dissolved, and the solution raised to boiling-point, and\nallowed to crystallise by cooling in a covered capsule. Beautiful\ncrystals form at the bottom, and the supernatant, saturated solution is\neasily decanted. If part of this solution be evaporated to dryness, the\nchloride obtained is found to be about five times less active than that\nwhich has crystallised out. The chloride is thus divided into two\nportions, A and B—portion A being more active than portion B. The\noperation is now repeated with each of the chlorides A and B, and in\neach case two new portions are obtained. When the crystallisation is\nfinished, the less active fraction of chloride A is added to the more\nactive fraction of chloride B, these two having approximately the same\nactivity. Thus there are now three portions to undergo afresh the same\ntreatment.\n\nThe number of portions is not allowed to increase indefinitely. The\nactivity of the most soluble portion diminishes as the number increases.\nWhen its activity becomes inconsiderable, it is withdrawn from the\nfractionation. When the desired number of fractions has been obtained,\nfractionation of the least soluble portion is stopped (the richest in\nradium), and it is withdrawn from the remainder.\n\nA fixed number of fractions is used in the process. After each series of\noperations, the saturated solution arising from one fraction is added to\nthe crystals arising from the following fraction; but if after one of\nthe series the most soluble fraction has been withdrawn, then, after the\nfollowing series, a new fraction is made from the most soluble portion,\nand the crystals of the most active portion are withdrawn. By the\nsuccessive alteration of these two processes, an extremely regular\nsystem of fractionation is obtained, in which the number of fractions\nand the activity of each remains constant, each being about five times\nas active as the subsequent one, and in which, on the one hand, an\nalmost inactive product is removed, whilst, on the other, is obtained a\nchloride rich in radium. The amount of material contained in these\nfractions gradually diminishes, becoming less as the activity increases.\n\nAt first six fractions were used, and the activity of the chloride\nobtained at the end was only 0·1 that of uranium.\n\nWhen most of the inactive matter has been removed, and the fractions\nhave become small, one fraction is removed from the one end, and another\nis added to the other end consisting of the active chloride previously\nremoved. A chloride richer in radium than the preceding is thus\nobtained. This system is continued until the crystals obtained are pure\nradium chloride. If the fractionation has been thoroughly carried out,\nscarcely any trace of the intermediate products remain.\n\nAt an advanced stage of the fractionation, when the quantity of material\nin each fraction is small, the separation by crystallisation is less\nefficacious, the cooling being too rapid and the volume of the solution\nto be decanted too small. It is then advisable to add water containing a\nknown quantity of hydrochloric acid; this quantity may be increased as\nthe fractionation proceeds."

        "content": "The advantage gained thus consists in increasing the quantity of the\nsolution, the solubility of the chlorides being less in water acidified\nwith hydrochloric acid than in pure water. By using water containing\nmuch acid, excellent separations are effected, and it is only necessary\nto work with three or four fractions.\n\nThe crystals, which form in very acid solution, are elongated needles,\nthose of barium chloride having exactly the same appearance as those of\nradium chloride. Both show double refraction. Crystals of barium\nchloride containing radium are colourless, but when the proportion of\nradium becomes greater, they have a yellow colouration after some hours,\nverging on orange, and sometimes a beautiful pink. This colour\ndisappears in solution. Crystals of pure radium chloride are not\ncoloured, so that the colouration appears to be due to the mixture of\nradium and barium. The maximum colouration is obtained for a certain\ndegree of radium present, and this fact serves to check the progress of\nthe fractionation.\n\nI have sometimes noticed the formation of a deposit composed of crystals\nof which one part remained uncoloured, whilst the other was coloured,\nand it seems possible that the colourless crystals might be sorted out.\n\nThe fractional precipitation of an aqueous solution of barium chloride\nby alcohol also leads to the isolation of radium chloride, which is the\nfirst to precipitate. This method, which I first employed, was finally\nabandoned for the one just described, which proceeds with more\nregularity. I have, however, occasionally made use of precipitation by\nalcohol to purify radium chloride which contains traces of barium\nchloride. The latter remains in the slightly aqueous alcoholic solution,\nand can thus be removed.\n\nM. Giesel, who, since the publication of our first researches, has been\npreparing radio-active bodies, recommends the separation of barium and\nradium by fractional crystallisation in water from a mixture of the\nbromides. I can testify that this method is advantageous, especially in\nthe first stages of the fractionation.\n\n_Determination of the Atomic Weight of Radium._\n\nIn the course of my work I determined at intervals the atomic weight of\nthe metal contained in specimens of barium chloride containing radium.\nWith each newly obtained product I carried the concentration as far as\npossible, so as to have from 0·1 grm. to 0·5 grm. of material containing\nmost of the activity of the mixture. From this small quantity I\nprecipitated with alcohol or with hydrochloric acid some milligrams of\nchloride for spectral analysis. Thanks to his excellent method, Demarçay\nonly required this small quantity of material to obtain the photograph\nof the spark spectrum. I made an atomic weight determination with the\nproduct remaining.\n\nI employed the classic method of weighing as silver chloride the\nchlorine contained in a known weight of the anhydrous chloride. As\ncontrol experiment, I determined the atomic weight of barium by the same\nmethod, under the same conditions, and with the same quantity of\nmaterial, first 0·5 grm. and then 0·1 grm. The figures obtained were\nalways between 137 and 138. I thus saw that the method gives\nsatisfactory results, even with a very small quantity of material.\n\nThe first two determinations were made with chlorides, of which one was\n230 times and the other 600 times as active as uranium. These two\nexperiments gave the same figure as the experiment with the pure barium\nchloride. There was therefore no hope of finding a difference except by\nusing a much more active product. The following experiment was made with\na chloride, the activity of which was about 3500 times as great as that\nof uranium; and this experiment enabled me, for the first time, to\nobserve a small but distinct difference; I found, as the mean atomic\nweight of the metal contained in this chloride, the number 140, which\nshowed that the atomic weight of radium must be higher than that of\nbarium. By using more and more active products, and obtaining spectra of\nradium of increasing intensity, I found that the figures obtained rose\nin proportion, as is seen in the following table (p. 28).\n\nThe figures of column A must only be looked upon as a rough estimate.\nThe calculation of the activity of strongly radio-active bodies is\ndifficult, for many reasons which will be discussed later.\n\nA.         │ M.\n3500        │140   Spectrum of radium faint.\n4700        │141\n7500        │145·8 Spectrum of radium strong, but that of\n│        barium predominating.\n────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOrder of Magnitude, │173·8 The two spectra of almost equal intensity.\n10^6 ...          │\n〃          │225   Only a trace of barium present.\n\nA represents the activity of the chloride, that of uranium being unity;\nM the atomic weight found.\n\nAt the termination of the processes described above, I obtained, in\nMarch, 1902, 0·12 grm. of radium chloride, of which Demarçay made the\nspectral analysis. This radium chloride, in the opinion of Demarçay, was\nfairly pure; its spectrum, however, showed the three principal barium\nlines with considerable intensity. I made four successive estimations of\nthe chloride, the results of which as follows:—\n\nAnhydrous radium chloride. Silver chloride.  M.\nI. 0·1150                     0·1130           220·7\nII. 0·1140                     0·1119           223·0\nIII. 0·11135                    0·1086           222·8\nIV. 0·10925                    0·10645          223·1\n\nI then re-purified this chloride, and obtained a much purer substance,\nin the spectrum of which the two strongest barium lines were very faint.\nGiven the sensitiveness of the spectrum reaction of barium, Demarçay\nestimated that the purified chloride contained only the merest traces of\nbarium, incapable of influencing the atomic weight to an appreciable\nextent. I made three determinations with this perfectly pure radium\nchloride. The results were as follows:—\n\nAnhydrous radium chloride. Silver chloride.  M.\nI.          0·09192               0·08890      225·3\nII.          0·08936               0·08627      225·8\nIII.          0·08839               0·08589      224·0\n\nThe mean of these numbers is 225. They were calculated in the same way\nas the preceding ones by considering radium as a bivalent element, the\nchloride having the formula RaCl_{2}, and taking for silver and chlorine\nthe values Ag = 107·8, Cl = 35·4.\n\nHence the atomic weight of radium is Ra = 225.\n\nThe weighings were made with a Curie aperiodic balance, perfectly\nregulated, accurate to the twentieth of a milligrm. This direct reading\nbalance permits of very rapid weighing, a condition which is essential\nin the case of the anhydrous chlorides of radium and barium, which\ngradually absorb moisture, in spite of the presence of desiccating\nsubstances in the balance. The bodies to be weighed were placed in a\nplatinum crucible; this crucible had been long in use, and its weight\ndid not vary the tenth part of a milligrm. during the course of one\noperation.\n\nThe hydrated chloride obtained by crystallisation was placed in the\ncrucible and heated till converted into the anhydrous chloride. When the\nchloride has been kept for several hours at 100° its weight becomes\nconstant, and does not change even if the temperature is raised to 200°.\nThe anhydrous chloride thus obtained constitutes, therefore, a perfectly\ndefinite body."

        "content": "The following is a series of determinations on this point. The chloride\n(100 m.g.) is dried in the oven at 55°, and placed in a desiccator over\nanhydrous phosphoric acid; it then gradually loses weight, which proves\nthat it still contains moisture; in the course of twelve hours the loss\nwas 3 m.g. The chloride is replaced in the stove, and the temperature\nraised to 100°. During this process, the chloride lost 6·3 m.g. in\nweight. After being left three hours fifteen minutes in the oven, it\nlost 2·5 m.g. more. The temperature was maintained for forty-five\nminutes between 100° and 120°, which caused a loss of weight of 0·1 m.g.\nThen after being kept for thirty minutes at 125°, the chloride showed no\ndiminution in weight. Then, however, after thirty minutes at 150°, it\nlost 0·1 m.g. Finally, after being heated for four hours at 200°, it\nlost 0·15 m.g. During these operations the crucible varied from 0·05\nm.g.\n\nAfter each determination of the atomic weight, the radium was converted\ninto the chloride in the following manner:—To the solution containing\nthe weighed radium nitrate and excess of silver nitrate was added pure\nhydrochloric acid; the silver chloride was filtered off; the solution\nwas evaporated to dryness several times with excess of pure hydrochloric\nacid. In this way the nitric acid is entirely removed.\n\nThe precipitated silver chloride was always radio-active and\nphosphorescent. In determining the amount of silver contained in it, I\nsatisfied myself that no ponderable amount of radium had been carried\ndown with it out of the solution. The method I pursued was to reduce the\nsilver chloride precipitated in the crucible by hydrogen generated from\ndilute hydrochloric acid and zinc; after washing, the crucible was\nweighed with the metallic silver contained in it.\n\nI made another experiment which showed that the weight of radium\nchloride regenerated was the same as that before beginning the\noperation.\n\nThese verifications are not so reliable as direct experiments; but they\nserve to indicate the absence of any significant error.\n\nFrom its chemical properties, radium is an element of the group of\nalkaline earths, being the member next above barium.\n\nFrom its atomic weight also, radium takes its place in Mendeleeff’s\ntable after barium with the alkaline earth metals, in the row which\nalready contains uranium and thorium.\n\n_Characteristics of the Radium Salts._\n\nThe salts of radium, chloride, nitrate, carbonate, and sulphate,\nresemble those of barium, when freshly prepared, but they gradually\nbecome coloured.\n\nAll the radium salts are luminous in the dark.\n\nIn their chemical properties, the salts of radium are absolutely\nanalogous to the corresponding salts of barium. However, radium chloride\nis less soluble than barium chloride; the solubility of the nitrates in\nwater is approximately the same.\n\nThe salts of radium are the source of a spontaneous and continuous\nevolution of heat.\n\n_Fractionation of Ordinary Barium Chloride._\n\nWe have endeavoured to determine whether commercial barium chloride\ncontains small quantities of radium chloride, which escape detection\nwith the means of estimation at our command. For this purpose we\nfractionated a great quantity of commercial barium chloride, in the hope\nof thus concentrating the trace of radium chloride if such were present.\n\nFifty kilos. of commercial barium chloride were dissolved in water; the\nsolution was precipitated by hydrochloric acid free from sulphuric acid,\nwhich yielded 20 kilos. of the precipitated chloride. This was dissolved\nin water and partially precipitated by hydrochloric acid, which gave 8·5\nkilos. of precipitated chloride. This chloride was fractionated by the\nmethod used for the barium chloride containing radium; and at the end of\nthe process, 10 grams of chloride were obtained, corresponding to the\nleast soluble part. This chloride showed no radio-activity; it therefore\ncontained no radium; this substance is, consequently, absent from the\nores of barium."

        "content": "_Methods of Investigation of the Radiation._\n\nIn order to investigate the radiation emitted by radio-active bodies,\nany one of the properties of this radiation can be utilised. Thus the\naction of the rays on photographic plates may serve, or their property\nof ionisation of the air, which renders it a conductor, or their\ncapacity for causing fluorescence of certain bodies. Henceforth, in\nspeaking of these different methods of working, I shall use the\nexpressions radiographic method, electrical method, fluoroscopic method.\n\nThe first two have been used from the beginning in the study of uranium\nrays; the fluoroscopic method can only be applied in the case of the new\nbodies which are strongly radio-active, for the feebly active bodies\nsuch as uranium and thorium produce no appreciable fluorescence. The\nelectrical method is the only one which serves for exact determinations\nof intensity; the other two are specially adapted for giving qualitative\nresults, and only furnish rough approximations. The results obtained\nwith the three methods just considered are not strictly comparable the\none with the other. The sensitive plate, the gas which is ionised, the\nfluorescent screen, are in reality receivers, which absorb the energy of\nthe radiation, and transform it into another kind of energy, chemical\nenergy, ionic energy, or luminous energy. Each receiver absorbs a\nfraction of the radiation, which depends essentially upon its nature.\nLater on, we shall see that the radiation is complex, that the fractions\nof the radiation absorbed by the different receivers may differ among\nthemselves both quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, it is neither\nevident, nor even probable, that the energy absorbed is entirely\ntransformed by the receiver into the form that we wish for observation;\npart of this energy may be transformed into heat, into the evolution of\nsecondary radiations which may or may not assist in the production of\nthe observed phenomenon, into chemical action which differs from that\nunder observation, &c., and here also the effective action of the\nreceiver, with reference to the end we have in view, depends essentially\nupon the nature of that receiver.\n\nLet us compare two radio-active substances, one containing radium and\nthe other polonium, and which show an equal degree of activity in the\ncondenser of Fig. 1. If each is covered with a thin leaf of aluminium,\nthe second appears considerably less active than the first, and the same\nis the case when they are placed under the same fluorescent screen, if\nthe latter is of sufficient thickness, or is placed at a certain\ndistance from the two radio-active bodies.\n\n_Energy of Radiation._\n\nWhatever be the method of research employed, the energy of radiation of\nthe new radio-active substances is always found to be considerably\ngreater than that of uranium and thorium. Thus it is that, at a short\ndistance, they act instantaneously upon a photographic plate, whereas an\nexposure of twenty-four hours is necessary when operating with uranium\nand thorium. A fluorescent screen is vividly illuminated by contact with\nthe new radio-active bodies, whilst no trace of luminosity is visible\nwith uranium and thorium. Finally, the ionising action upon air is\nconsiderably stronger in the ratio of 10^6 approximately. But it is,\nstrictly speaking, not possible to estimate the _total intensity of the\nradiation_, as in the case of uranium, by the electrical method\ndescribed at the beginning (Fig. 1). With uranium, for example, the\nradiation is almost completely absorbed by the layer of air between the\nplates, and the limiting current is reached at a tension of 100 volts.\nBut the case is different for strongly radio-active bodies. One portion\nof the radiation of radium consists of very penetrating rays, which\npenetrate the condenser and the metallic plates, and are not utilised in\nionising the air between the plates. Further, the limiting current\ncannot always be obtained for the tensions supplied; for example, with\nvery active polonium the current remains proportional to the tension\nbetween 100 and 500 volts. Therefore the experimental conditions which\ngive a simple interpretation are not realised, and, consequently, the\nnumbers obtained cannot be taken as representing the measurement of the\ntotal radiation; they merely point to a rough approximation.\n\n_Complex Nature of the Radiation._\n\nThe researches of various physicists (MM. Becquerel, Meyer and von\nSchweidler, Giesel, Villard, Rutherford, M. and Mdme. Curie) have proved\nthe complex nature of the radiation of radio-active bodies. It will be\nconvenient to specify three kinds of rays, which I shall denote,\naccording to the notation adopted by Mr. Rutherford, by the letters α,\nβ, γ.\n\nI. The α-rays are very slightly penetrating, and appear to constitute\nthe principal part of the radiation. These rays are characterised by the\nlaws by which they are absorbed by matter. The magnetic field acts very\nslightly upon them, and they were formerly thought to be quite\nunaffected by the action of this field. However, in a strong magnetic\nfield, the α-rays are slightly deflected; the deflection is caused in\nthe same manner as with cathode rays, but the direction of the\ndeflection is reversed; it is the same as for the canal rays of the\nCrookes tubes.\n\nII. The β-rays are less absorbable as a whole than the preceding ones.\nThey are deflected by a magnetic field in the same manner and direction\nas cathode rays.\n\nIII. The γ-rays are penetrating rays, unaffected by the magnetic field,\nand comparable to Röntgen rays.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\n\nConsider the following imaginary experiment:—Some radium, R, is placed\nat the bottom of a small deep cavity, hollowed in a block of lead, P\n(Fig. 4). A sheaf of rays, rectilinear and slightly expanded, streams\nfrom the receptacle. Let us suppose that a strong uniform magnetic field\nis established in the neighbourhood of the receptacle, normal to the\nplane of the figure and directed towards the back. The three groups of\nrays, α, β, γ, will now be separated. Then rather faint γ-rays continue\nin their straight path without a trace of deviation. The β-rays are\ndeflected in the manner of cathode rays, and describe circular paths in\nthe plane of the figure. If the receptacle is placed on a photographic\nplate, A C, the portion, B C, of the plate which receives the β-rays is\nacted upon. Lastly, the α-rays form a very intense shaft which is\nslightly deflected, and which is soon absorbed by the air. These rays\ndescribe in the plane of the figure a path of great curvature, the\ndirection of the deflection being the reverse of that with the β-rays.\n\nIf the receptacle is covered with a thin sheet of aluminium (0·1 m.m.\nthick), the α-rays are suppressed almost entirely, the β-rays are\nlessened, and the γ-rays do not appear to be absorbed to any great\nextent.\n\n_Action of the Magnetic Field._\n\nWe have seen that the rays emitted by radio-active bodies have many\nproperties common to cathode rays and to Röntgen rays. Cathode rays, as\nwell as Röntgen rays, ionise the air, act on photographic plates, cause\nfluorescence, undergo no regular deflection. But the cathode rays differ\nfrom Röntgen rays in being deflected from their rectilinear path by the\naction of the magnetic field, and in the transportation of charges of\nnegative electricity.\n\nThe fact that the magnetic field acts upon the rays emitted by\nradio-active substances was discovered almost simultaneously by MM.\nGiesel, Meyer and von Schweidler, and Becquerel. These physicists\nobserved that the rays of radio-active substances are deflected by the\nmagnetic field in the same manner and direction as the cathode rays;\ntheir observations were in relation to the β-rays.\n\nM. Curie demonstrated that the radiation of radium comprises two groups\nof quite distinct rays, of which one is readily deflected by the\nmagnetic field (β-rays), whilst the other seems to be unaffected by the\naction of this field (α- and γ-rays)."

        "content": "M. Becquerel did not find that the specimens of polonium prepared by us\nemitted rays of the cathode kind. On the contrary, he first noticed the\neffect of the magnetic field on a specimen of polonium prepared by\nhimself. None of the polonium prepared by us ever gave rise to rays of\nthe cathode order.\n\nThe polonium of M. Giesel only gives rise to these rays when recently\nprepared, and it is probable that the emission is due to the phenomenon\nof induced radio-activity of which we shall speak later.\n\nThe following are experiments which prove that one portion of the\nradiation of radium, and one portion only, consists of easily deflected\nrays (β-rays). These experiments were done according to the electrical\nmethod.\n\nThe radio-active body A (Fig. 5) sends forth radiations in the direction\nA D between the plates P and P′. The plate P is now at a potential of\n500 volts, plate P′ is connected to an electrometer and to a quartz\nelectric piezometer. The intensity of the current passing through the\nair under the influence of the radiations is measured. The magnetic\nfield can be established at will perpendicular to the plane of the\nfigure over the whole region E E E E. If the rays are deflected, even\nslightly, they no longer pass between the plates, and the current is\nsuppressed. The region of the passage of the rays is surrounded with\nmasses of lead, B, B′, B″, and by the armatures of the electro-magnet;\nwhen the rays are deflected, they are absorbed by the masses of lead B\nand B′.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\n\nThe results obtained depend essentially on the distance, A D, of the\nradiating substance, A, from the condenser at D. If the distance A D is\ngreat enough (greater than 7 c.m.), most of the radium rays (90 to 100\nper cent) arriving at the condenser are deflected and suppressed for a\nfield of 2500 units. These are the β-rays. If the distance A D is less\nthan 65 m.m., a smaller part of the rays are deflected by the action of\nthe field; this portion is also entirely deflected by a field of 2500\nunits, and the proportion of the rays suppressed is not increased by\nincreasing the field from 2500 to 7000 units.\n\nThe proportion of the rays not suppressed by the field increases with\ndecrease of the distance, A D, between the radiating body and the\ncondenser. For small distances, the rays which can be easily deflected\nform a very small fraction of the total radiation. The penetrating rays\nare therefore, for the most part, deviable rays of the cathode order\n(β-rays).\n\nUnder the experimental conditions just described, the action of the\nmagnetic field on the α-rays could not be well observed for the fields\nemployed. The chief radiation, apparently undergoing no deflection,\nobserved at a short distance from the radiating source, consisted of\nα-rays; the undeflected radiation observed at a greater distance\nconsisted of γ-rays.\n\nIf an absorbing lamina (aluminium or black paper) is placed in the path\nof the bundle of rays, those which pass through are nearly all deflected\nby the field in such a way that, with the aid of the screen and the\nmagnetic field, almost all the radiation is suppressed in the condenser,\nthe remainder being due to the γ-rays, the proportion of which is small.\nThe α-rays are absorbed by the screen.\n\nAn aluminium plate of 1/100 m.m. thickness is sufficient for the\nsuppression of almost all the rays not readily deflected when the\nsubstance is far enough from the condenser; for smaller distances (34\nm.m. and 51 m.m.) two pieces of this aluminium foil are necessary to\ngive the same result.\n\nSimilar determinations were made with four substances containing radium\n(chlorides or carbonates) of very different activity; analogous results\nwere obtained.\n\nIt may be remarked that, in all cases, the penetrating rays deflected by\nthe magnet (β-rays) form only a small fraction of the total radiation;\nthey influence but slightly the determinations in which the whole\nradiation is made use of to produce conductivity of the air.\n\nThe radiation emitted by polonium may be studied by the electrical\nmethod. When the distance, A D, of the polonium from the condenser is\nvaried, no current is observed at first while the distance is fairly\ngreat; on nearing the polonium, the radiation suddenly becomes manifest\nwith great intensity; the current then increases uniformly whilst\napproaching the polonium, but the magnetic field produces no appreciable\neffect under these conditions. The radiation of polonium is apparently\nlimited in space, and does not pass into the air beyond a kind of sheath\nsurrounding the substance to a thickness of several centimetres.\n\nThe interpretation of the experiments I have just described must be\naccompanied by some important general reservations. In speaking of the\nproportion of the rays deflected by the magnet, I refer only to that\nportion of the radiation capable of causing a current in the condenser.\nIn employing the fluorescent action of the Becquerel rays, or their\naction on photographic plates, the proportion would probably be\ndifferent—a measure of intensity having, as a rule, no meaning except\nfor the method of measurement adopted.\n\nThe rays of polonium are α-rays. In the experiments just described, I\nobserved no action of the magnetic field upon them, but the experimental\nconditions were such that a slight deflection would pass unnoticed.\n\nThe experiments made by the radiographic method confirmed the preceding\nresults. Taking radium as the source of radiation, and receiving the\nimpression on a plate parallel to the primitive shaft and normal to the\nfield, a very clear print is obtained of two shafts separated by the\naction of the field, the one deflected, the other not deflected. The\nβ-rays constitute the deflected beam; the α-rays, being very slightly\ndeflected, are not to be distinguished from the undeflected bundle of\nthe γ-rays.\n\n_Deflected β-Rays._\n\nThe experiments of M. Giesel and MM. Meyer and von Schweidler showed\nthat the radiation of the radio-active bodies is, in part at least,\ndeflected by a magnetic field, and that this deflection resembles that\nof the cathode rays. M. Becquerel investigated the action of the field\non the rays by the radiographic method. The experimental arrangement was\nthat of Fig. 4. The radium was placed in the lead receptacle, P, and\nthis receptacle was placed on the sensitive face of a photographic\nplate, A C, covered with black paper. The whole was placed between the\npoles of an electro-magnet, the magnetic field being normal to the plane\nof the figure.\n\nIf the field is directed to the back of this plane, the part B C of the\nplate is acted upon by rays which, after having described circular\npaths, return to the plate and strike it at a right angle. These rays\nare β-rays.\n\nM. Becquerel has demonstrated that the impression consists of a wide\ndiffused band, a continuous spectrum indeed, showing that the sheaf of\ndeviable rays emitted by the source is formed of an infinite number of\nradiations unequally deflected. If the gelatin of the plate be covered\nwith different absorbent screens (paper, glass, metals), one portion of\nthe spectrum is suppressed, and it is found that the rays most deflected\nby the magnetic field—otherwise those which have the smallest radius of\ncurvature—are the most completely absorbed. With each screen, the\nimpression on the plate begins at a certain distance from the source of\nradiation, this distance being proportional to the absorptive power of\nthe screen.\n\n_Charge of the Deflected Rays._"

Perrin and M.\nLenard, they are capable of carrying their charge through the metallic\nenvelopes connected to earth and through isolating screens. At every\npoint where the cathode rays are absorbed, there is a continuous\nevolution of negative electricity. We have proved that the same is the\ncase for the deflected β-rays of radium. _The deviable β-rays of radium\nare charged with negative electricity._\n\n(NOTE.—Let the radio-active substance be placed on one of the plates of\na condenser, this plate being connected to earth; the second plate is\nconnected to an electrometer, it receives and absorbs the rays emitted\nby the substance. If the rays are charged, a continuous flow of\nelectricity into the electrometer should be observed. In this\nexperiment, carried out in air, we were not able to detect a charge\naccompanying the rays, but such an experiment is not delicate. The air\nbetween the plates being caused by the rays to conduct, the electrometer\nis no longer isolated, and can only respond to charges if these be\nsufficiently strong. In order that the α-rays may not interfere with the\nexperiment, they may be suppressed by covering the source of radiation\nwith a thin metallic screen. We repeated this experiment, without more\nsuccess, by causing the rays to pass through the interior of a Faraday\ncylinder in connection with the electrometer).\n\nAccording to the preceding experiments, it was evident that the charge\nof the rays of the radiating body employed was a weak one.\n\nIn order to fix a feeble evolution of electricity upon the conductor\nwhich absorbs the rays, this conductor should be completely insulated;\nthis is effected by screening it from the air, either by placing it in a\ntube with a very perfect vacuum, or by surrounding it with a good solid\ndielectric. We employed the latter arrangement.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\n\nA conducting disc, M M (Fig. 6), is connected by the wire, _t_, to the\nelectrometer; the disc and wire are completely enveloped by the\ninsulating substance _i i i i_; the whole is again surrounded with the\nmetallic covering, E E E E, which is in electric connection with the\nearth. The insulator, _p p_, and the metallic envelope are very thin\nupon one of the faces of the disc. This face is exposed to the radiation\nof the barium and radium salt, R, placed outside in a lead receptacle.\nThe rays emitted by the radium penetrate the metallic envelope and the\ninsulating lamina, _p p_, and are absorbed by the metallic disc, M M.\nThe latter then becomes the source of a continuous evolution of negative\nelectricity, as determined by the electrometer, and is measured by means\nof a quartz piezometer.\n\nThe current thus created is very weak. With very active barium-radium\nchloride, forming a layer of 2·5 sq. c.m. in area, and of 0·2 c.m. in\nthickness, a current of magnitude 10^{–11} ampères is obtained, the rays\nutilised having traversed, before being absorbed by the disc M M, a\nthickness of aluminium of 0·01 m.m., and a thickness of ebonite of 0·3\nm.m.\n\nWe used successively lead, copper, and zinc for the disc M M, ebonite\nand paraffin for the insulator; the results obtained were the same.\n\nThe current diminishes with increasing distance from the source of\nradiation, R, also when a less active product is used.\n\nWe obtained the same results again when the disc M M is replaced by a\nFaraday cylinder filled with air, and covered outside with insulating\nmaterial. The opening of the cylinder, closed by the thin insulating\nplate, _p p_, was opposite the radiating source.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\n\nFinally, we made the inverse experiment, which was to place the lead\nreceptacle with the radium in the centre of the insulating material and\nin connection with the electrometer (Fig. 7), the whole being surrounded\nwith the metallic covering connected to earth.\n\nUnder these conditions, it is evident from the electrometer that the\nradium has a positive charge equal in magnitude to the negative charge\nof the former experiment. The radium rays penetrate the thin dielectric\nplate, _p p_, and leave the conductor inside carrying with them negative\nelectricity.\n\nThe α-rays of radium do not interfere in these experiments, being almost\ncompletely absorbed by a very thin layer of matter. The method just\ndescribed is not suitable for the study of the charge of the rays of\npolonium, these rays very slightly penetrating. We observed no\nindication of any charge in the case of polonium, which gives rise to\nα-rays only; but, for the reason just given, no conclusion can be drawn\nfrom this.\n\nThus, in the case of the deflected β-rays of radium, as in the case of\ncathode rays, the rays carry a charge of electricity. But, hitherto, the\nexistence of electric charges uncombined with matter has been unknown.\nIn the study of the emission of the β-rays of radium, we are therefore\nled to make use of the theory which is in vogue for the study of cathode\nrays. In this ballistic theory, formulated by Sir William Crookes, since\ndeveloped and completed by Prof. J. J. Thomson, the cathode rays consist\nof extremely minute particles, which are hurled from the cathode with\ngreat velocity, and which are charged with negative electricity. We\nmight similarly conceive that radium sends into space negatively\nelectrified particles.\n\nA specimen of radium, enclosed in a solid thin perfectly insulated\nenvelope, should become spontaneously charged to a very high potential.\nBy the ballistic hypothesis the potential would increase until the\npotential difference of the surrounding conductors became sufficient to\nhinder the ejection of the electrified particles and to cause their\nreturn to the source of radiation.\n\nWe have performed an experiment on these lines. A specimen of very\nactive radium was enclosed for some time in a glass vessel. In order to\nopen the vessel, we made a trace on the glass with a glass cutter.\nWhilst so doing, we clearly heard the report of a spark, and upon\nexamining the vessel with a magnifying glass, we observed that the glass\nhad been pierced by a spark at the spot where it had been weakened by\nthe scratch. The phenomenon produced is comparable to the rupture of the\nglass of an overcharged Leyden jar.\n\nThe same phenomenon occurred with another glass. Further, at the moment\nof the passing of the spark, M. Curie, who was holding the glass, felt\nthe electric shock of discharge in his fingers.\n\nCertain kinds of glass have good insulating properties. If the radium is\nenclosed in a sealed glass vessel, well insulated, it is to be expected\nthat, at a given moment, the vessel will be spontaneously perforated.\n\n_Radium is the first example of a body which is spontaneously charged\nwith electricity._\n\n_Action of the Electric Field upon the Deflected β-Rays of Radium._\n\nThe β-rays of radium, being analogous to the cathode rays, should be\ndeflected by an electric field in a manner similar to the latter;\n_i.e._, as would a particle of matter negatively charged and hurled into\nspace with a great velocity. The existence of such a deflection has been\ndemonstrated both by M. Dorn and M. Becquerel."

        "content": "Let us consider the case of a ray which traverses the space situated\nbetween the two plates of a condenser. Suppose the direction of the ray\nparallel to the plates: when an electric field is established between\nthe latter, the ray is subjected to the action of this uniform field\nalong its whole path in the condenser l. By reason of this action the\nray is deflected towards the positive plate and describes the arc of a\nparabola; on leaving the field, it continues its path in a straight\nline, following the tangent to the arc of the parabola at the point of\nexit. The ray can be received on a photographic plate perpendicular to\nits original direction. Observations are taken of the impression\nproduced on the plate when the field is zero, and when it has a known\nvalue, and from that is deduced the value of the deflection, δ, which is\nthe distance of the points in which the new direction of the ray and its\noriginal direction meet a common plane perpendicular to the original\ndirection. If h is the distance of this plane from the condenser,\n_i.e._, at the edge of the field, we have, by a simple calculation,—\n\n_e_F_l_ (_l_/2 + _h_)\nδ = —————————————————————;\n_mv_^2\n\n_m_ being the mass of the moving particles, _e_ its charge, _v_ its\nvelocity, and F the strength of the field.\n\nThe experiments of M. Becquerel enable him to assign a value approaching\nto δ.\n\n_Relation of the Charge to the Mass for a Particle Negatively Charged\nEmitted by Radium._\n\nWhen a material particle having a mass _m_ and a negative charge _e_, is\nprojected with a velocity _v_ into a uniform magnetic field\nperpendicular to its initial velocity, this particle describes, in a\nplane normal to the field and passing through its initial velocity, an\narc of a circle of radius ρ, so that—H being the strength of the\nfield—we have the relation—\n\n_m_\nHρ = ——— _v_.\n_e_\n\nIf, for the same ray, the deflection, δ, and the radius of curvature, ρ,\nbe measured in a magnetic field, values could be found from these two\nexperiments for the ratio _e_/_m_ and for the velocity, _v_.\n\nThe experiments of M. Becquerel threw the first light upon this subject.\nThey gave for the ratio _e_/_m_ a value approximately equal to 10^7\nabsolute electro-magnetic units, and for v a magnitude of 1·6 × 10^{10}.\nThese values are of the same order of magnitude as those of the cathode\nrays.\n\nAccurate experiments have been made on the same subject by M. Kaufmann.\nThis physicist subjected a narrow beam of radium rays to the\nsimultaneous action of an electric field and a magnetic field, the two\nfields being uniform and having a similar direction, normal to the\noriginal direction of the beam. The impression produced on a plate\nnormal to the primitive beam and placed beyond the limits of the field\nwith reference to the source, has the form of a curve, each point of\nwhich corresponds to one of the original beam. The most penetrating and\nleast deflected rays are at the same time those with the greatest\nvelocity.\n\nIt follows from the experiments of M. Kaufmann, that for the radium\nrays, of which the velocity is considerably greater than that of the\ncathode rays, the ratio _e_/_m_ decreases, while the velocity increases.\n\nAccording to the researches of J. J. Thomson and Townsend, we may assume\nthat the moving particle, which constitutes the ray, possesses a charge,\n_e_, equal to that carried by an atom of hydrogen during electrolysis,\nthis charge being the same for all the rays. We are therefore led to the\nconclusion that the mass of the particle, _m_, increases with increase\nof velocity.\n\nThese theoretical considerations lead to the idea that the inertia of\nthe particle is due to its state of charge during motion, the velocity\nof an electric charge in motion being incapable of modification without\nexpenditure of energy. To state it otherwise, the inertia of the\nparticle is of electro-magnetic origin, and the mass of the particle\nis—in part at least—a virtual mass or an electro-magnetic mass. M.\nAbraham goes further, and assumes that the mass of the particle is\nentirely an electro-magnetic mass. If, according to this hypothesis, the\nvalue of this mass, _m_, be calculated for a known velocity, _v_, we\nfind that _m_ approaches infinity when _v_ approaches the velocity of\nlight, and that _m_ approaches a constant value when the velocity, _v_,\nis much less than that of light. The experiments of M. Kaufmann are in\nagreement with the results of this theory, the importance of which is\ngreat because it foreshadows the possibility of establishing mechanical\nbases upon the dynamical of little particles of matter charged in a\nstate of motion.\n\nThese are the figures obtained by M. Kaufmann for _e_/_m_ and _v_.\n\n_e_/_m_          _v_c.m./sec. │\nElectro-magnetic units.               │\n1·865 × 10^7            0·7  × 10^{10}│For cathode rays (Simon).\n──────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────\n1·31  × 10^7            2·36 × 10^{10}│For radium rays (Kaufmann).\n1·17  × 10^7            2·48 × 10^{10}│             〃\n0·97  × 10^7            2·59 × 10^{10}│             〃\n0·77  × 10^7            2·72 × 10^{10}│             〃\n0·63  × 10^7            2·83 × 10^{10}│             〃\n\nM. Kaufmann concludes, from comparison of his experiments with the\ntheory, that the limiting value of the ratio _e_/_m_ for radium rays of\nrelatively small velocity would be the same as the value _e_/_m_ for\ncathode rays.\n\nThe most complete experiments of M. Kaufmann were made with a minute\nquantity of pure radium chloride, with which we provided him.\n\nAccording to M. Kaufmann’s experiments, certain β-rays of radium possess\na velocity very near to that of light. These rapid rays seem to possess\ngreat penetrating capacity towards matter.\n\n_Action of the Magnetic Field upon the α-Rays._\n\nIn a recent work, Mr. Rutherford announced that, in a powerful electric\nor magnetic field, the α-rays of radium are slightly deflected, in the\nmanner of particles positively electrified and possessing great\nvelocity. Mr. Rutherford concludes from his experiments that the\nvelocity of the α-rays is of the order of magnitude 2·5 × 10^9c.m./sec.\nand that the ratio _e_/_m_ for these rays is of the order of magnitude 6\n× 10^3, which is 10^4 times as great as for the deflected β-rays. We\nshall see later that these conclusions of Mr. Rutherford are in\nagreement with the properties already known of the α-radiation, and that\nthey account, in part at least, for the law of absorption of this\nradiation.\n\nThe experiments of Mr. Rutherford have been confirmed by M. Becquerel.\nM. Becquerel has further demonstrated that polonium rays behave in a\nmagnetic field like the α-rays of radium, and that, for the same field,\nthey seem to have the same curvature as the latter.\n\nIt also appears from M. Becquerel’s experiments that the α-rays do not\nform a magnetic spectrum, but act rather like a homogeneous radiation,\nall the rays being equally deflected.\n\n_Action of the Magnetic Field on the Rays of other Radio-active\nSubstances._\n\nWe have just seen that radium gives off α-rays comparable to the tube\nrays, β-rays comparable to cathode rays, and γ-rays which are\npenetrating and not deflected. Polonium gives off α-rays only. Amongst\nthe other radio-active substances, actinium seems to behave like radium,\nbut the study of its radiation has not yet advanced so far as in the\ncase of radium. As regards the faintly radio-active bodies, we know\nto-day that uranium and thorium give rise to α-rays as well as β-rays\n(Becquerel, Rutherford).\n\n_Proportion of β-Rays in the Radiation of Radium._"

        "content": "As I have already mentioned, the proportion of β-rays increases with\nincrease of distance from the source of radiation. These rays never\noccur alone, and for great distances the presence of γ-rays is always\ndiscernible. The presence of very penetrating, undeflected rays in the\nradiation of radium was first observed by M. Villard. These rays\nconstitute only a small portion of the radiation measured by the\nelectrical method, and their presence escaped our notice in our first\nexperiments, so that we believed falsely that the radiation at great\ndistances contained only rays capable of deflection.\n\nThe following are the numerical results obtained with experiments made\nby the electrical method with an apparatus similar to that of Fig. 5.\nThe radium was only separated from the condenser by the surrounding air.\nI shall indicate by the letter _d_ the distance from the source of\nradiation to the condenser. The numbers of the second line represent the\ncurrent subsisting when the magnetic field is acting, supposing the\ncurrent obtained with no field equal to 100 for each distance. These\nnumbers may be considered as giving the percentage of the total α- and\nγ-rays, the deflection of the α-rays having been scarcely observable\nwith the conditions employed.\n\nAt great distances there are no α-rays, and the undeflected radiation is\ntherefore of the γ kind only.\n\nExperiments made at short distances:—\n\n_d_, in centimetres             3·4  5·1  6·0  6·5\nPercentage of undeflected rays 74   56   33   11\n\nExperiments made at long distances with a product considerably more\nactive than that which was used for the preceding series:—\n\n_d_, in centimetres             14  30 53 80 98\nPercentage of undeflected rays  12  14 17 14 16\n───────────────────────────────────────────────\n_d_                            124 157\nPercentage of undeflected rays  14  11\n\nIt is thus evident that after a certain distance the proportion of\nundeflected rays in the radiation is approximately constant. These rays\nprobably all belong to the γ species.\n\nThe following is another series of experiments in which the radium was\nenclosed in a very narrow glass tube, placed below the condenser and\nparallel to the plates. The rays emitted traversed a certain thickness\nof glass and air before entering the condenser:—\n\n_d_, in centimetres            2·5  3·3  4·1  5·9  7·5  9·6 11·3\nPercentage rays not deflected 33   33   21   16   14   10    9\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n_d_                           13·9 17·2\nPercentage rays not deflected  9   10\n\nAs in the preceding experiments, the number of the second line\napproximate to a constant value, when the distance _d_ increases, but\nthe limit is reached for smaller distances than in the preceding series,\nbecause the α-rays have been more completely absorbed by the glass than\nthe β- and γ-rays.\n\nThe following experiment shows that a thin sheet of aluminium (0·01 m.m.\nthick) absorbs principally α-rays. The product being placed 5 c.m. from\nthe condenser, the proportion of rays other than β, when the magnetic\nfield is acting, is about 71 per cent. When the same substance is\ncovered with the sheet of aluminium, the distance remaining the same,\nthe radiation transmitted is found to be almost totally deflected by the\nmagnetic field, the α-rays having been absorbed by the aluminium. The\nsame result is obtained when paper is used as the absorbing screen.\n\nThe greatest part of the radiation of radium consists of α-rays, which\nare probably emitted principally by the superficial layer of the\nradiating matter. When the thickness of the layer of radiating matter is\nvaried, the intensity of the current increases with this thickness; the\nincrease is not proportional to the thickness for the whole of the\nradiation; it is, moreover, more considerable for the β-rays than for\nthe α-rays, so that the proportion of β-rays increases with the\nthickness of the active layer. The source of radiation being placed at a\ndistance of 5 c.m. from the condenser, it is found that for a thickness\nequal to 0·4 m.m. of the active layer, the total radiation is given by\nthe number 28, and the proportion of the β-rays is 29 per cent. By\nmaking the layer 2 m.m. thick, _i.e._, five times as thick, a total\nradiation equal to 102, and a proportion of β-rays equal to 45 per cent\nare obtained. The total radiation which exists at this distance has\ntherefore been increased in the ratio of 3·6, and the β-radiation has\nbecome five times as strong.\n\nThe preceding experiments were made by the electrical method. When the\nradiographic method is used, certain results seem to be in contradiction\nwith what precedes. In the experiments of M. Villard, a beam of radium\nrays, subjected to the action of the magnetic field, was received on to\na pile of photographic plates. The undeflected and penetrating γ-beam\npassed through all the plates, leaving its trace on each. The deflected\nβ-beam produced an impression on the first plate only. This beam\nappeared therefore to contain no rays of great penetration.\n\nOn the contrary, in our experiments a beam which is propagated in the\nair contains at the greatest distances accessible to observation about\n9/10 of β-rays, and the same is the case when the source of radiation is\nenclosed in a little sealed glass vessel. In M. Villard’s experiments,\nthese deflected and penetrating β-rays did not affect the photographic\nplates beyond the first, because they are to a great extent diffused in\nall directions by the first solid obstacle encountered, and no longer\nform a beam. In our experiments the rays given off by radium and\ntransmitted through the glass of the vessel were also probably scattered\nby the glass, but the vessel being very small would itself act as a\nsource of β-rays at its surface, and we were able to follow the course\nof the latter to a great distance from the vessel.\n\nThe cathode rays of Crookes tubes can only traverse very thin screens\n(aluminium screens of 0·01 m.m. thickness). A beam of rays striking the\nscreen normally is scattered in all directions; but the diffusion\nbecomes less with diminishing thickness of the screen, and for very thin\nscreens the emerging beam is practically the prolongation of the\nincident beam.\n\nThe deflected β-rays of radium behave in a similar manner, but the\ntransmitted beam experiences, for the same thickness of screen, a much\nslighter modification. According to the experiments of M. Becquerel, the\nvery readily deflected β-rays of radium (those with a relatively small\nvelocity) are powerfully scattered by an aluminium screen of thickness\n0·1 m.m.; but the penetrating and less deflected rays (rays of the\ncathode kind of great velocity) pass through this screen without being\nsensibly diffused, whatever be the inclination of the screen to the\ndirection of the beam. The β-rays of great velocity penetrate without\ndiffusion a much greater thickness of paraffin (several centimetres),\nand in this the curvature of the beam produced by the magnetic field can\nbe traced. The thicker the screen, and the more absorbent the material\nof which it is composed, the greater is the modification of the\ndeflected primitive beam, because, with increasing thickness of screen,\ndiffusion occurs progressively among fresh groups of rays of increasing\npenetration.\n\nThe β-rays of radium experience a diffusion in passing through the air,\nwhich is very marked for readily deflected rays, but which is much\nslighter than that produced by equal thicknesses of solid substances.\nFor this reason, the β-rays traverse long distances in the air.\n\n_Penetrating Power of the Radiation of Radio-active Bodies._"

        "content": "Since the beginning of the researches on radio-active bodies,\ninvestigations of the absorption produced by different screens upon the\nrays given off by these bodies have been carried on. In a previous paper\non this subject I gave figures (quoted at the beginning of this work)\nrepresenting the penetrating power of uranium and thorium rays. Mr.\nRutherford has made a special study of the radiation of uranium, and\nproved it to be heterogeneous. Mr. Owens has arrived at the same results\nfor thorium rays. When the discovery of strongly radio-active bodies\nimmediately followed upon this, the penetrating power of their rays was\nalso studied by various physicists (Becquerel, Meyer and von Schweidler,\nCurie, Rutherford). The first observations brought to light the\ncomplexity of the radiation, which seems to be a general phenomenon, and\ncommon to the radio-active bodies. In them we have sources which give\nrise to a variety of radiations, each of which has a power of\npenetration proper to itself.\n\nRadio-active bodies emit rays which are propagated both in the air and\n_in vacuo_. The propagation is rectilinear; this fact is proved by the\ndistinctness and shape of the shadows formed by interposing bodies\nopaque to the radiation between the source and the sensitive plate or\nfluorescent screen which serves as receiver, the source being of small\nmagnitude in comparison with its distance from the receiver. Various\nexperiments demonstrating the rectilinear propagation of uranium,\nradium, and polonium rays have been made by M. Becquerel.\n\nIt is interesting to know the distance that rays can travel in air. We\nhave found that radium emits rays which can be detected in the air at a\ndistance of several metres from the source. In certain of our electrical\ndeterminations, the action of the source upon the air of the condenser\nmade itself felt at a distance of between 2 and 3 metres. We have also\nobtained fluorescent effects and radiographic impressions at similar\ndistances. The experiments are not easily carried out, except with very\nintense radio-active sources, because, independently of the absorption\nby the air, the action upon a given receiver varies inversely as the\nsquare of the distance from a source of small dimensions. This\nradiation, which travels a long distance in the case of radium,\ncomprises rays of the cathode kind and rays which are undeflected;\nhowever, the deflected rays predominate, according to the results of the\nexperiments already mentioned. The greater part of the radiation\n(α-rays) is, on the contrary, limited in air to a distance of about 7\nc.m. from the source.\n\nI made several experiments with radium enclosed in a little glass\nvessel. The rays emerging from the vessel, after traversing a certain\nspace of air, were received in a condenser, which served to measure\ntheir ionising capacity by the usual electrical method. The distance,\n_d_, from the source to the condenser was varied, and the current of\nsaturation, _i_, obtained in the condenser was measured. The following\nare the results of one of the series of determinations:—\n\n_d_, c.m. _i._  _i_ × _d_^2 × 10^{–3}.\n10 127             13\n20  38             15\n30  17·4           16\n40  10·5           17\n50   6·9           17\n60   4·7           17\n70   3·8           19\n100  1·65           17\n\nAfter a certain distance, the intensity of radiation varies inversely as\nthe square of the distance from the condenser.\n\nThe radiation of polonium is only propagated in air to a distance of a\nfew centimetres (4 to 6 c.m.) from the source of radiation.\n\nIn the case of the absorption of radiations by solid screens, we find\nanother fundamental difference between radium and polonium. Radium emits\nrays capable of penetrating great thicknesses of solid matter, _e.g._,\nseveral centimetres of lead or of glass. The rays which have passed\nthrough a great thickness of a solid body are extremely penetrating, and\nit is practically impossible to absorb them entirely by any material\nwhatever. But these rays form only a small fraction of the total\nradiation, the greater part of which is absorbed by a slight thickness\nof solid matter.\n\nPolonium emits rays which are readily absorbed, and which can only pass\nthrough extremely thin screens.\n\nThe following are figures showing the absorption produced by an\naluminium lamina of thickness 0·01 m.m. This lamina was placed above and\nalmost in contact with the substance. The direct radiation and that\ntransmitted by the aluminium were measured by the electrical method\n(apparatus of Fig. 1); the current of saturation was practically\nobtained in every case. I have represented the activity of the radiating\nbody by _a_, that of uranium being unity.\n\n_a._         Fraction of\nradiation\ntransmitted.\nChloride of barium and radium                      57             0·32\nBromide of barium and radium                       43             0·30\nChloride of barium and radium                    1200             0·30\nSulphate of barium and radium                    5000             0·29\nSulphate of barium and radium                  10,000             0·32\nMetallic bismuth and polonium                                     0·22\nCompounds of uranium                                              0·20\nCompounds of thorium in a thin layer                              0·38\n\nWe see that radium compounds of different nature and activity give very\nsimilar results, as I have already pointed out in the case of uranium\nand thorium compounds at the beginning of this work. We see also that,\ntaking into account the whole of the radiation, and with a given\nabsorbent screen, the different radio-active bodies can be arranged in\nthe following decreasing order of penetrating power:—Thorium, radium,\npolonium, uranium.\n\nThese results are similar to those which have been published by Mr.\nRutherford.\n\nMr. Rutherford also finds that the order is the same when air is the\nabsorbent substance. But it is probable that this order has no absolute\nvalue, and would not be maintained independently of the nature and\nthickness of the screen. Experiment shows, indeed, that the law of\nabsorption is very different for polonium and radium, and that, for the\nlatter, the absorption of the rays of each of the three groups must be\nconsidered separately.\n\nPolonium is particularly well adapted to the study of α-rays, because\nthe specimens which we possess emit no other kind of rays. I made a\npreliminary series of experiments with extremely active recently\nprepared specimens of polonium. I found the absorbability of the rays to\nincrease with increase of thickness of the matter traversed. This\nsingular law of absorption is contrary to that known for other kinds of\nradiation.\n\nI employed for this research our apparatus for the determination of\nelectrical conductivity arranged in the following manner:—\n\nThe two plates of a condenser, P P and P′ P′ (Fig 8), are horizontally\ndisposed in a metallic box, B B B B, connected to earth. The active\nbody, A, placed in a thick metallic box, C C C C, connected with the\nplate P′ P′, acts upon the air of the condenser across a metallic sheet,\nT; the rays which pass through the sheet are alone utilised for\nproducing the current, the electric field being limited by the sheet.\nThe distance, A T, of the active body from the sheet may be varied. The\nfield between the plates is established by means of a battery. By\nplacing in A upon the active body different screens, and by adjusting\nthe distance A T, the absorption of rays which travel long or short\ndistances in the air may be determined.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\n\nThe following are the results obtained with polonium:—"

        "content": "For a certain value of the distance A T (4 c.m. and more), no current\npasses; the rays do not penetrate the condenser. When the distance A T\nis diminished, the appearance of the rays in the condenser is manifested\nsomewhat suddenly, a weak current changing to one of considerable\nstrength for a slight diminution of distance; the current then increases\nregularly as the active body continues to approach the sheet T.\n\nWhen the active body is covered with a sheet of aluminium 1/100 m.m.\nthick, the absorption produced by the lamina becomes greater, the\ngreater the distance A T.\n\nIf a second similar lamina of aluminium be placed upon the first, each\nabsorbs a fraction of the radiation it receives, and this fraction is\ngreater for the second lamina than for the first.\n\nIn the following table I have represented in the first line the\ndistances in centimetres between the polonium and the sheet T; in the\nsecond line the percentage of the rays transmitted by a sheet of\naluminium; in the third line the percentage of the rays transmitted by\ntwo sheets of the same aluminium:—\n\nDistance A T                                 3·5 2·5 1·9  1·45  0·5\nPercentage of rays transmitted by one lamina 0   0   5   10    25\nPercentage of rays transmitted by two laminæ 0   0   0    0     0·7\n\nIn these experiments the distance of the plates, P and P′, was 3 c.m. We\nsee that the interposition of the aluminium screen diminishes the\nintensity of the radiation to a greater degree at further distances than\nat nearer distances.\n\nThis effect is still more marked than the preceding figures seem to\nindicate. For a distance of 0·5 c.m. 25 per cent represents the mean\npenetration for all the rays which pass beyond this distance. If, for\nexample, only those rays between 0·5 c.m. and 1 c.m. be comprehended,\nthe penetration would be greater. And if the plate P be placed at a\ndistance of 0·5 c.m. from P′ the fraction of the radiation transmitted\nby the aluminium lamina (for A T = 0·5 c.m.) is 47 per cent, and through\ntwo laminæ it is 5 per cent of the original radiation.\n\nI have recently performed a second series of experiments with these same\nspecimens of polonium, the activity of which was considerably\ndiminished, the interval of time between the two series of experiments\nbeing three years.\n\nIn the former experiments, polonium nitrite was used; in the latter, the\npolonium was in the state of metallic particles obtained by fusing the\nnitrite with potassium cyanide.\n\nI found that the radiation of polonium had preserved its essential\ncharacteristics, and I discovered new results. The following, for\ndifferent values of the distance A T, are the fractions of the radiation\ntransmitted by a screen composed of four superposed very thin leaves of\nbeaten aluminium.\n\nDistance A T, in centimetres                  0  1·5  2·6\nPercentage of rays transmitted by the screen 76 66   39\n\nI also found that the fraction of the radiation absorbed by a given\nscreen increases with the thickness of the material already traversed by\nthe radiation, but this only occurs after the distance A T has reached a\ncertain value. When this distance is zero (the polonium being in contact\nwith the sheet, either outside or inside the condenser), it is observed\nthat with several similar superposed screens, each absorbs the same\nfraction of the radiation it receives; otherwise expressed, the\nintensity of the radiation diminishes therefore according to an\nexponential law as a function of the thickness of the material\ntraversed, as in the case of homogeneous radiation transmitted by the\nlamina without changing its nature.\n\nThe following numerical results are given with reference to these\nexperiments:—\n\nFor a distance A T equal to 1·5 c.m. a thin aluminium screen transmits\nthe fraction 0·51 of the radiation it receives when acting alone, and\nthe fraction 0·34 of the radiation it receives when it is preceded by\nanother similar screen.\n\nOn the contrary, for a distance A T equal to zero, the same screen\ntransmits in both the cases considered the same fraction of the\nradiation it receives, and this fraction is equal to 0·71; it is\ntherefore greater than in the preceding case.\n\nThe following numbers indicate for a distance A T equal to 0 and for a\nsuccession of thin superposed screens, the ratio of the radiation\ntransmitted to the radiation received for each screen:—\n\nSeries of nine very thin copper   Series of seven very thin aluminium\nleaves.                             leaves.\n0·72                                0.69\n0·78                                0.94\n0·75                                0.95\n0·77                                0.91\n0·70                                0.92\n0·77                                0.93\n0·69                                0.94\n0·79\n0·68\n\nTaking into account the difficulties of the manipulation of very thin\nscreens and of the superposition of screens in contact, the numbers of\neach column may be looked upon as constant; the first number only of the\naluminium column indicates a greater absorption than that indicated by\nthe following numbers.\n\nThe α-rays of radium behave similarly to the rays of polonium. These\nrays may be investigated almost isolated by deflecting to one side the\nβ-rays with the magnetic field; the γ-rays seem of slight importance in\ncomparison with the α-rays. The operation can only be carried on at some\ndistance from the source of radiation. The following are the results of\nan experiment of this kind. The fraction of the radiation transmitted by\na lamina of aluminium 0·01 m.m. thick is measured; this screen was\nplaced always in the same position, above and at a little distance from\nthe source of radiation. With the apparatus of Fig. 5, the current\nproduced in the condenser for different values of the distance A D is\nobserved, both with and without the screen:—\n\nDistance A D                                    6·0 5·1  3·4\nPercentage of rays transmitted by the aluminium 3   7   24\n\nThe rays which travel furthest in the air are those most absorbed by the\naluminium. There is therefore a great similarity between the absorbable\nα-rays of radium and the rays of polonium.\n\nThe deflected β-rays and the undeflected penetrating γ-rays are, on the\ncontrary, of a different nature. The experiments, notably of MM. Meyer\nand von Schweidler, clearly show that, considering the radiation of\nradium as a whole, the penetrating power of this radiation increases\nwith the thickness of the material traversed, as is the case of Röntgen\nrays. In these experiments the α-rays produce scarcely any effect, being\nfor the most part suppressed by very thin absorbent screens. Those which\npenetrate are, on the one hand, β-rays more or less scattered; on the\nother hand, γ-rays, which appear similar to Röntgen rays.\n\nThe following are the results of some of my experiments on the subject:—\n\nThe radium is enclosed in a glass vessel. The rays, which emerge from\nthe vessel, traverse 30 c.m. of air, and are received upon a series of\nglass plates, each of thickness 1·3 m.m.; the first plate transmits 49\nper cent of the radiation it receives, the second transmits 84 per cent\nof the radiation it receives, the third transmits 85 per cent of the\nradiation it receives.\n\nIn another series of experiments the radium was enclosed in a glass\nvessel placed 10 c.m. from the condenser which received the rays. A\nseries of similar screens of lead each 0·115 m.m. thick were placed on\nthe vessel.\n\nThe ratio of the radiation transmitted to the radiation received is\ngiven for each of the successive screens by the following numbers:—\n\n0·40 0·60 0·72 0·79 0·89 0·92 0·94 0·94 0·97\n\nFor a series of four screens of lead, each of which was 1·5 m.m. thick,\nthe ratio of the radiation transmitted to the radiation received was\ngiven for the successive screens by the following numbers:—\n\n0·09 0·78 0·84 0·82"

        "content": "The results of these experiments show that when the thickness of the\nlead traversed increases from 0·1 m.m. to 6 m.m., the penetrating power\nof the radiation increases.\n\nI found that, under the experimental conditions mentioned, a screen of\nlead 1·8 c.m. thick transmits 2 per cent of the radiation it receives; a\nscreen of lead 5·3 c.m. thick transmits 0·4 per cent of the radiation it\nreceives. I also found that the radiation transmitted by a thickness of\nlead of 1·5 m.m. consists largely of rays capable of deflection (cathode\norder). The latter are therefore capable of traversing not only great\ndistances in the air, but also considerable thicknesses of very\nabsorbent solids, such as lead.\n\nIn investigating with the apparatus of Fig. 2 the absorption exercised\nby an aluminium screen 0·01 m.m. thick upon the total radiation of\nradium, the screen being always placed at the same distance from the\nradiating body, and the condenser being placed at a variable distance, A\nD, the results obtained are the sum of those due to the three groups of\nthe radiation. At a long distance the penetrating rays predominate, and\nthe absorption is slight; at a short distance the α-rays predominate,\nand the absorption becomes less with nearer approach to the substance;\nfor an intermediate distance the absorption passes through a maximum and\nthe penetration through a minimum.\n\nDistance A D                                 7·1  6·5  6·0  5·1  3·4\nPercentage of rays transmitted by aluminium 91   82   58   41   48\n\nCertain experiments made in connection with absorption always\ndemonstrate a certain similarity between the α-rays and the β-rays. Thus\nit was that M. Becquerel discovered that the absorbent action of a solid\nscreen upon the β-rays increases with the distance of the screen from\nthe source, such that if the rays are subjected to a magnetic field, as\nin Fig. 4, a screen placed in contact with the source of radiation\nallows a larger portion of the magnetic spectrum to be in evidence than\ndoes the same screen placed upon the photographic plate. This variation\nof the absorbent effect of the screen with the distance of the screen\nfrom the source is similar to that which occurs with the α-rays; this\nhas been verified by MM. Meyer and von Schweidler, who operated by means\nof the fluoroscopic method; M. Curie and I observed the same fact when\nworking by the electrical method. However, when the radium is enclosed\nin a glass tube and placed at a distance from the condenser, which is\nitself enclosed in a thin aluminium box, it becomes a matter of\nindifference whether the screen be placed against the source or against\nthe condenser; the current obtained is the same in both cases.\n\nThe investigation of the α-rays led me to the reflection that these rays\nbehave like projectiles having a certain initial velocity, and which\nlose their force on encountering obstacles. These rays, moreover, travel\nby rectilinear propagation, as has been shown by M. Becquerel in the\nfollowing experiment:—Polonium emitting rays was placed in a very narrow\nstraight cavity hollowed in a sheet of cardboard. Thus a linear source\nof radiation was produced. A copper wire, 1·5 m.m. in diameter, was\nplaced parallel and opposite to the source at a distance of 4·9 m.m.\nBeyond was placed a parallel photographic plate at a distance of 8·65\nm.m. After an exposure of ten minutes, the geometric shadow of the wire\nwas perfectly reproduced, with a narrow penumbra corresponding to the\nsize of the source. The same experiment succeeded equally well when a\ndouble leaf of beaten aluminium was placed against the wire, through\nwhich the rays must pass.\n\nThere are therefore rays capable of giving perfect geometric shadows.\nThe experiment with the aluminium shows that these rays are not\nscattered in traversing the screen, and that this screen does not give\nrise to any noticeable extent to secondary rays similar to the secondary\nrays of the Röntgen rays.\n\nThe experiments of Mr. Rutherford show that the projectiles which\nconstitute the α-rays are deflected by a magnetic field, as if they were\npositively charged. The deflection in a magnetic field becomes less as\nthe product _mv_/_e_ becomes greater; _m_ being the mass of the\nparticle, _v_ its velocity, and _e_ its charge. The cathode rays of\nradium are but slightly deflected, because their velocity is enormous;\nthey are, on the other hand, very penetrating, because each particle has\na very small mass together with a great velocity. But particles which,\nwith an equal charge and a less velocity, have a greater mass, would be\nalso only slightly influenced by the action of the field, and would give\nrise to very absorbable rays. From the results of Mr. Rutherford’s\nexperiments, this seems to take place in the case of the α-rays.\n\nThe penetrating γ-rays appear to be of quite another nature and similar\nto Röntgen rays.\n\nWe have now seen how complex a phenomenon is the radiation of\nradio-active bodies. The difficulties of investigation are increased by\nthe question as to whether the radiation undergoes a merely selective\nabsorption on the part of the material, or whether a more or less\nradical transformation.\n\nLittle is so far known with regard to this question. If the radiation of\nradium be regarded as containing rays both of the cathode and Röntgen\nspecies, it might be expected to undergo transformations in traversing\nscreens. It is known:—Firstly, that cathode rays emerging from a Crookes\ntube through an aluminium window are greatly scattered by the aluminium;\nand, further, that the passage through the screen entails a diminution\nof the velocity of the rays. In this way, cathode rays with a velocity\nequal to 1·4 × 10^{10} c.m. lose 10 per cent of their velocity in\npassing through 0·01 m.m. of aluminium. Secondly, cathode rays on\nstriking an obstacle give rise to the production of Röntgen rays.\nThirdly, Röntgen rays, on striking a solid obstacle, give rise to the\nproduction of _secondary rays_, which partly consist of cathode rays.\n\nThe existence, by analogy, of all these preceding phenomena may\ntherefore be predicted for the rays of radio-active substances.\n\nIn investigating the transmission of polonium rays through a screen of\naluminium, M. Becquerel observed neither the production of secondary\nrays nor any transformation into cathode rays.\n\nI endeavoured to demonstrate a transformation of the rays of polonium by\nusing the method of interchangeable screens. Two superposed screens,\nE_{1} and E_{2}, being traversed by the rays, the order in which they\nare traversed should be immaterial if the passage through the screens\ndoes not transform the rays; if, on the contrary, each screen transforms\nthe rays during transmission, the order of the screens is of moment. If,\nfor example, the rays are transformed into more absorbable rays in\npassing through lead, and no such effect is produced by aluminium, then\nthe system lead-aluminium will be more opaque than the system\naluminium-lead; this takes place with Röntgen rays.\n\nMy experiments show that this phenomenon is produced with the rays of\npolonium. The apparatus employed was that of Fig. 8. The polonium was\nplaced in the box, C C C C, and the absorbing screens, of necessity very\nthin, were placed upon the metallic sheet T."

This conclusion accords with the experiments in\nwhich, of two similar superposed metallic screens, the first is less\nabsorbent than the second. From this it is probable that the\ntransforming action of a screen increases with the distance of the\nscreen from the source. This fact has not been verified, and the nature\nof the transformation has not been studied in detail.\n\nI repeated the same experiments with a very active salt of radium; the\nresult was negative. I only observed insignificant variations in the\nintensity of the radiation transmitted with interchange of the order of\nthe screens. The following systems of screens were experimented with:—\n\nAluminium, thickness 0·55  m.m.\nAluminium, thickness 0·55  m.m.\nAluminium, thickness 0·55  m.m.\nAluminium, thickness 1·07  m.m.\nAluminium, thickness 0·55  m.m.\nAluminium, thickness 1·07  m.m.\nAluminium, thickness 0·15  m.m.\nAluminium, thickness 0·15  m.m.\nAluminium, thickness 0·15  m.m.\nPlatinum, thickness  0·01  m.m.\nLead, thickness      0·1   m.m.\nTin, thickness       0·005 m.m.\nCopper, thickness    0·05  m.m.\nBrass, thickness     0·005 m.m.\nBrass, thickness     0·005 m.m.\nPlatinum, thickness  0·01  m.m.\nZinc, thickness      0·05  m.m.\nLead, thickness      0·1   m.m.\n\nThe system lead-aluminium was slightly more opaque than the system\naluminium-lead, but the difference was not great.\n\nThus, I was unable to discover an appreciable transformation of the rays\nof radium. However, in various radiographic experiments, M. Becquerel\nobserved very intense effects due to scattered or secondary rays,\nemitted by solid screens which received radium rays. Lead seemed to be\nthe most active substance in this respect.\n\n_Ionising Action of Radium Rays on Insulating Liquids._\n\nM. Curie has pointed out that radium rays and Röntgen rays act upon\nliquid dielectrics as upon air, imparting to them a certain electrical\nconductivity. The experiment was carried out in the following manner\n(Fig. 9):—\n\nThe experimental liquid is placed in a metal vessel, C D E F, into which\na thin copper tube, A B, is plunged; these two pieces of metal serve as\nelectrodes. The outer vessel is maintained at a known potential, by\nmeans of a battery of small accumulators, one pole of which is connected\nto earth. The tube, A B, is connected to the electrometer. When a\ncurrent traverses the liquid the electrometer is kept at zero by means\nof a quartz electrical piezometer, which gives the strength of the\ncurrent. The copper tube, M N M′ N′, connected to earth, serves as a\nguard tube, preventing the passage of the current through the air. A\nbulb containing the radium-barium salt may be placed at the bottom of\nthe tube, A B; the rays act on the liquid after having penetrated the\nglass of the bulb and the sides of the metal tube. The radium may also\nbe allowed to act by placing the bulb beneath the side, D E.\n\nIn working with Röntgen rays the course of the rays is through side D E.\n\nThe increase of conductivity by the action of the radium rays or the\nRöntgen rays seems to be produced in the case of all liquid dielectrics;\nbut in order to determine this increase, the conductivity of the liquid\nitself must be so slight as not to mask the effect of the rays.\n\nM. Curie obtained results of the same order of magnitude with both\nradium rays and Röntgen rays.\n\nWhen investigating with the same apparatus the conductivity of air or of\nanother gas under the action of the Becquerel rays, the intensity of the\ncurrent obtained is found to be proportional to the difference of\npotential between the electrodes, as long as the latter does not exceed\na few volts; but at higher tensions, the intensity of the current\nincreases less and less rapidly, and the saturation current is\npractically attained for a tension of 100 volts.\n\nLiquids examined with the same apparatus and the same radio-active body\nbehave differently; the intensity of the current is proportional to the\ntension when the latter varies between 0 and 450 volts, and when the\ndistance between the electrodes does not exceed 6 m.m.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\n\nThe figures of the following table multiplied by 10^{–11} give the\nconductivity in megohms per c.c.:—\n\nCarbon bisulphide 20\nPetroleum ether   15\nAmylene           14\nBenzine            4\nLiquid air         1·3\nVaseline oil       1·6\n\nWe may, however, assume that liquids and gases behave similarly, but\nthat, in the case of liquids, the current remains proportional to the\ntension up to a much higher limit than in the case of gases. It\ntherefore seemed probable that the limit of proportionality could be\nlowered by using a much more feeble radiation, and this idea was\nverified by experiment. The radio-active body employed was 150 times\nless active than that which had served for the previous experiments. For\ntensions of 50, 100, 200, 400 volts, the intensities of the current were\nrepresented respectively by the numbers 109, 185, 255, 335. The\nproportionality was no longer maintained, but the current showed great\nvariation when the difference of potential was doubled.\n\nSome of the liquids examined are nearly perfect insulators when\nmaintained at a constant temperature and when screened from the action\nof the rays. Such are liquid air, petroleum ether, vaseline oil, and\namylene. It is therefore very easy to study the effect of the rays.\nVaseline oil is much less sensitive to the action of the rays than is\npetroleum ether. This fact may have some relation to the difference in\nvolatility which exists between these two hydrocarbons. Liquid air,\nwhich has boiled for some time in the experimental vessel, is more\nsensitive to the action of the rays than that newly poured in; the\nconductivity produced by the rays is one-fourth as great again in the\nformer case. M. Curie has investigated the action of the rays upon\namylene and upon petroleum ether at temperatures of +10° and –17°. The\nconductivity due to the radiation diminishes by one-tenth of its value\nonly, in passing from 10° to –17°.\n\nIn the experiments in which the temperature of the liquid is varied, the\ntemperature of the radium may be either that of the surrounding\natmosphere or that of the liquid; the same result is obtained in both\ncases. This leads to the conclusion that the radiation of radium does\nnot vary with the temperature, and remains unaltered even at the\ntemperature of liquid air. This fact has been verified directly by\nmeasurements.\n\n_Various Effects and Applications of the Ionising Action of the Rays\nEmitted by Radio-active Substances._\n\nThe rays of the new radio-active substances have a strongly ionising\naction upon air. By the action of radium _the condensation of\nsupersaturated water vapour_ can be easily induced, just as happens by\nthe action of cathode rays and Röntgen rays."

        "content": "Under the influence of the rays emitted by the new radio-active\nsubstances, _the distance of discharge between two metallic conductors\nfor a given difference of potential is increased_; to put it otherwise,\nthe passage of the spark is facilitated by these rays.\n\nIn causing conductivity, by the action of radio-active bodies, in the\nair in the neighbourhood of two metallic conductors, one of which is\nconnected to earth and the other to a well-insulated electrometer, the\nelectrometer is seen to be permanently deflected, which gives a measure\nof the electromotive force of the battery formed by the air and the two\nmetals (electromotive force of contact of the two metals, when they are\nseparated by air). This method of measurement was employed by Lord\nKelvin and his students, the radiating body being uranium; a similar\nmethod had been previously employed by M. Perrin, who was using the\nionising action of Röntgen rays.\n\nRadio-active bodies may be employed in the study of atmospheric\nelectricity. The active substance is enclosed in a little box of thin\naluminium fixed at the extremity of a metal wire connected with the\nelectrometer. The air is made to conduct in the neighbourhood of the end\nof the wire, and the latter adopts the potential of the surrounding air.\nRadium thus replaces, with advantage, the flames or the apparatus of\nrunning water of Lord Kelvin, till now in general use for the\ninvestigation of atmospheric electricity.\n\n_Fluorescent and Luminous Effects._\n\nThe rays emitted by the new radio-active bodies cause fluorescence of\ncertain substances. M. Curie and myself first discovered this phenomenon\nwhen causing polonium to act upon a layer of barium platinocyanide\nthrough aluminium foil. The same experiment succeeds yet more easily\nwith barium containing radium. When the substance is strongly\nradio-active the fluorescence produced is very beautiful.\n\nA large number of bodies are capable of becoming phosphorescent or\nfluorescent by the action of the Becquerel rays. M. Becquerel studied\nthe effect upon the uranium salts, the diamond, &c. M. Bary has\ndemonstrated that the salts of the metals of the alkalis and alkaline\nearths, which are all fluorescent under the action of luminous rays and\nRöntgen rays, are also fluorescent under the action of the rays of\nradium. Paper, cotton, glass, &c., are all caused to fluoresce in the\nneighbourhood of radium. Among the different kinds of glass, Thuringian\nglass is specially luminous. Metals do not seem to become luminous.\n\nBarium platinocyanide is most conveniently used when the radiation of\nthe radio-active bodies is to be investigated by the fluoroscopic\nmethod. The effect of the radium rays may be followed at distances\ngreater than 2 m. Phosphorescent zinc sulphide is made extremely\nluminous, but this body has the inconvenient property of preserving its\nluminosity for some time after the action of the rays has ceased.\n\nThe fluorescence produced by radium may be observed when the fluorescent\nscreen is separated from the radium by absorbent screens. We were able\nto observe the illumination of a screen of barium platinocyanide across\nthe human body. However, the action is incomparably greater when the\nscreen is placed immediately in contact with the radium, being separated\nfrom it by no solid screen at all. All the groups of rays appear capable\nof producing fluorescence.\n\nIn order to observe the action of polonium, the substance must be placed\nclose to the fluorescent screen, without the intervention of a solid\nscreen, unless the latter be extremely thin.\n\nThe luminosity of fluorescent substances exposed to the action of\nradio-active bodies diminishes with time. At the same time the\nfluorescent substance undergoes a transformation. The following are\nexamples:—\n\nRadium rays transform barium platinocyanide into a brown, less luminous\nvariety (an action similar to that produced by Röntgen rays, and\ndescribed by M. Villard). Uranium sulphate and potassium sulphate are\nsimilarly altered. The changed barium platinocyanide is partially\nregenerated by the action of light. If the radium be placed beneath a\nlayer of barium platinocyanide spread on paper, the platinocyanide\nbecomes luminous; if the system be kept in the dark, the platinocyanide\nbecomes changed, and its luminosity diminishes considerably. But if the\nwhole be exposed to light, the platinocyanide is partially regenerated,\nand if the whole is replaced in darkness the luminosity reappears with\nvigour. By means of a fluorescent body and a radio-active body, we have\ntherefore obtained a system which acts as a phosphorescent body capable\nof long duration of phosphorescence.\n\nGlass made fluorescent by the action of radium becomes coloured brown or\nviolet. At the same time its fluorescence diminishes. If the glass thus\nchanged be warmed, it is decolorised, and when this occurs the glass\nbecomes luminous. The glass has now regained its fluorescent property in\nthe same degree as before the transformation.\n\nZinc sulphide, which has been exposed for a sufficient length of time to\nthe action of radium, gradually becomes used up, and loses its\nphosphorescent property, whether under the action of radium or that of\nlight.\n\nThe diamond becomes phosphorescent under the action of radium, and may\nthus be distinguished from paste imitations, which have only a very\nfaint luminosity.\n\nAll the barium-radium compounds _are spontaneously luminous_. The dry\nanhydrous halogen salts emit a particularly intense light. This\nillumination cannot be seen in broad daylight, but it is easily visible\nin the twilight or by gas-light. The light emitted may be strong enough\nto read by in the dark. The light emitted emanates from the entire body\nof the product, whilst in the case of a common phosphorescent body, the\nlight emanates specially from the portion of the surface illuminated.\nRadium products lose much of their luminosity in damp air, but they\nregain it on drying (Giesel). There is apparently conservation of\nluminosity. After many years no sensible modification is produced in the\nluminosity of feebly active products, kept in the dark in sealed tubes.\nIn the case of very active and very luminous radium-barium chloride, the\nlight changes colour after several months; it becomes more violet and\nloses in intensity; at the same time the product undergoes\ntransformations; on re-dissolving the salt in water and drying it\nafresh, the original luminosity is restored.\n\nSolutions of barium-radium salts, which contain a large proportion of\nradium, are equally luminous; this fact may be observed by placing the\nsolution in a platinum capsule, which not being itself luminous permits\nof the faint luminosity of the solution being seen.\n\nWhen a solution of a barium-radium salt contains crystals deposited in\nit, these crystals are luminous at the bottom of the solution, and much\nmore so than the solution itself, so that they alone appear luminous.\n\nM. Giesel has made a preparation of barium-radium platinocyanide. When\nthis salt is newly crystallised, it has the appearance of ordinary\nbarium platinocyanide and is very luminous. But gradually the salt\nbecomes spontaneously coloured, taking a brown tint, the crystals at the\nsame time becoming dichroic. In this state the salt is much less\nluminous, although its radio-activity is increased. The radium\nplatinocyanide, prepared by M. Giesel, changes still more rapidly.\n\nRadium compounds are the first example of self-luminous bodies.\n\n_Evolution of Heat by the Salts of Radium._"

        "content": "MM. Curie and Laborde have recently discovered that _the salts of radium\nare the source of a spontaneous and continuous evolution of heat_. This\nevolution has the effect of keeping the salts of radium at a temperature\nhigher than that of their surroundings; an excess of temperature of 1·5°\nhas been observed. This excess of temperature is dependent upon the\nthermal insulation of the body. MM. Curie and Laborde have determined\nthe amount of heat produced in the case of radium. They found that the\noutput is of the order of magnitude of 100 calories per grm. of radium\nper hour. One grm.-atom (225 grm.) of radium give rise in one hour to\n22,500 cal., a quantity of heat comparable to that produced by the\ncombustion of 1 grm.-atom (1 grm.) of hydrogen. So great an evolution of\nheat can be explained by no ordinary chemical reaction, more\nparticularly as the condition of the radium remains unaffected for\nyears. The evolution of heat might be attributed to a slow\ntransformation of the radium atom. If this were the case, we should be\nled to conclude that the quantities of energy generated during the\nformation and transformation of the atoms are considerable, and that\nthey exceed all that is so far known.\n\n_Chemical Effects produced by the New Radio-active Bodies._\n\n_Colourations._—The radiations of strongly radio-active bodies are\ncapable of causing certain chemical reactions. The rays emitted by\nradium products exercise colouring actions upon glass and porcelain.\n\nThe colouration of glass, generally brown or violet, is very deep; it is\nproduced in the body of the glass, and remains after removal of the\nradium. All glasses become coloured after a longer or a shorter interval\nof time, and the presence of lead is not essential. This fact may be\ncompared to that recently observed of the colouration of the glass of\nvacuum tubes, after having been long in use for the production of\nRöntgen rays.\n\nM. Giesel has demonstrated that the crystallised halogen salts of the\nalkali metals become coloured under the influence of radium, as under\nthe action of cathode rays. M. Giesel points out that similar\ncolourations are obtained when the salts of the alkalis are exposed to\nsodium vapour.\n\nI investigated the colouration of a collection of glasses of known\ncomposition, kindly lent me for the occasion by M. Le Chatelier. I\nobserved no great variety in the colouration. It is generally brown,\nviolet, yellow, or grey. It appears to be associated with the presence\nof the alkali metals.\n\nWith the pure crystallised alkali salts more varied and more vivid\ncolours are obtained; the salt, originally white, becomes blue, green,\nyellow, brown, &c.\n\nM. Becquerel has discovered that yellow phosphorus is transformed into\nthe red variety by the action of radium.\n\nPaper is changed and coloured by the action of radium. It becomes\nbrittle, scorched, and, finally, resembles a colander perforated with\nholes.\n\nUnder some circumstances there is a production of ozone in the\nneighbourhood of very active compounds. Rays emerging from a sealed jar\ncontaining radium do not produce ozone in the air they pass through. On\nthe contrary, a strong odour of ozone is detected when the jar is\nopened. In a general way, ozone is produced in the air when the latter\nis in direct contact with the radium. Communication by a channel, even\nif extremely narrow, suffices; it appears as if the production of ozone\nis associated with the propagation of induced radio-activity, of which\nwe shall speak later.\n\nRadium compounds appear to change with lapse of time, doubtless under\nthe action of their own radiation. It was seen above that crystals of\nbarium-radium chloride, which are colourless when formed, become\ngradually coloured first yellow or orange, then pink; this colouration\ndisappears in solution. Barium-radium chloride generates oxygen\ncompounds of chlorine; the bromide those of bromine. These slow changes\ngenerally manifest themselves some time after the preparation of the\nsolid product, which at the same time changes in form and colour,\nbecoming yellow or violet. The light emitted also becomes more violet.\n\nA solution of a radium salt evolves hydrogen (Giesel).\n\nPure radium salts seem to undergo the same changes as those containing\nbarium. However, crystals of the chloride, deposited in acid solution,\ndo not become sensibly coloured after some time has elapsed, whereas\ncrystals of barium-radium chloride, rich in radium, become deeply\ncoloured.\n\n_Production of Thermo-luminosity._—Certain bodies, such as fluorite,\nbecome luminous when heated; they are thermo-luminescent. Their\nluminosity disappears after some time, but the capacity of becoming\nluminous afresh through heat is restored to them by the action of a\nspark, and also by the action of radium. Radium can thus restore to\nthese bodies their thermo-luminescent property. Fluorite when heated\nundergoes a change, which is accompanied by the emission of light. If\nthe fluorite is afterwards subjected to the action of radium, an inverse\nchange occurs, which is also accompanied by an emission of light.\n\nAn absolutely similar phenomenon occurs when glass is exposed to radium\nrays. Here also a change is produced in the glass while luminous from\nthe effect of the radium rays; this change shows itself in the\ncolouration which appears and gradually increases. If the glass is\nafterwards heated, the inverse change takes place, the colour\ndisappears, and this phenomenon is accompanied by production of light.\nIt appears very probable that we have here a change of a chemical\nnature, and the production of light is associated with this change. This\nphenomenon may be general. It might be that the production of\nfluorescence by the action of radium and the luminosity of radium\ncompounds is of necessity associated with some chemical or physical\nchange in the substance emitting the light.\n\n_Radiographs._—The radiographic action of the new radio-active bodies is\nvery marked. However, the method of operating should be very different\nwith polonium and radium. Polonium acts only at very short distances,\nand its action is considerably weakened by solid screens; it is\npractically annihilated by means of a screen of slight thickness (1 m.m.\nof glass). Radium acts at considerably greater distances. The\nradiographic action of radium rays may be observed at more than 2 m.\ndistance in air, even when the active product is enclosed in a glass\nvessel. The rays acting under these conditions belong to the β- and\nγ-groups. Owing to the differences in transparency of different\nmaterials to the rays, radiographs of different objects may be obtained,\nas in the case of Röntgen rays. Metals are, as a rule, opaque, with the\nexception of aluminium, which is very transparent. There is no\nnoteworthy difference of transparency between flesh and bone. The\noperation may be carried on at a great distance and with a source of\nvery small dimensions; and very delicate radiographs are thus produced.\nThe beauty of the radiograph is enhanced by deflecting to one side the\nβ-rays, by means of a magnetic field, and utilising only the γ-rays. The\nβ-rays, in traversing the object to be radiographed, undergo a certain\namount of diffusion, and thus cause a slight fog. In suppressing them, a\nlonger time of exposure is necessary, but better results are obtained.\nThe radiograph of an object, such as a purse, requires one day with a\nradiating source composed of several centigrams of a radium salt,\nenclosed in a glass vessel, and placed at a distance of 1 m. from the\nsensitive plate, in front of which the object is placed. If the source\nis at a distance of 20 c.m. from the plate, the same result is obtained\nin one hour. In the immediate vicinity of the source of radiation, a\nsensitive plate is instantaneously acted upon.\n\n_Physiological Effects._\n\nRadium rays exert an action upon the epidermis. This has been observed\nby M. Walkhoff and confirmed by M. Giesel, since also by MM. Becquerel\nand Curie."

        "content": "If a celluloid or thin indiarubber capsule containing a very active salt\nof radium be placed upon the skin, and be left thus for some time, a\nredness is produced upon the skin, either immediately or at the end of\nsome time, which is longer in proportion as the action is weaker; this\nred spot appears in the place which has been exposed to the action; the\nlocal change in the skin appears and acts like a burn. In certain cases\na blister is formed. If the exposure was of long duration, an ulceration\nis produced which is long in healing. In one experiment, M. Curie caused\na relatively weak radio-active product to act upon his arm for ten\nhours. The redness appeared immediately, and later a wound was caused\nwhich took four months to heal. The epidermis was locally destroyed, and\nformed again slowly and with difficulty, leaving a very marked scar. A\nradium burn with half-an-hour’s exposure appeared after fifteen days,\nformed a blister and healed in fifteen days. Another burn, caused by an\nexposure of only eight minutes, occasioned a red spot which appeared two\nmonths after, its effect being quite insignificant.\n\nThe action of radium upon the skin can take place across metal screens,\nbut with weakened effect.\n\nThe action of radium upon the skin has been investigated by Dr. Daulos,\nat the Hospital of St. Louis, as a process of treating certain\naffections of the skin, similar to the treatment with the Röntgen rays\nor the ultra-violet rays. In this respect radium gives encouraging\nresults; the epidermis partially destroyed by the action of the radium\nis renewed in a healthy condition. The action of radium is more\npenetrating than that of light, and its use is easier than that of light\nor of Röntgen rays. The study of the conditions of application is of\nnecessity rather lengthy, because the effect of the application does not\nat once appear.\n\nM. Giesel has observed the action of radium upon plant leaves. The\nleaves thus treated turn yellow and wither away.\n\nM. Giesel has also discovered the action of radium rays upon the eye. If\na radio-active substance be placed in the dark in the vicinity of the\nclosed eye or of the temple, a sensation of light fills the eye. This\nphenomenon has been studied by MM. Himstedt and Nagel. These physicists\nhave demonstrated that the centre of the eye is rendered fluorescent by\nthe action of radium, and this explains the sensation of light\nexperienced. Blind people whose retina is intact are sensitive to the\naction of radium, whilst those whose retina is diseased do not\nexperience any sensation of luminosity.\n\nRadium rays either arrest or hinder the development of colonies of\nmicrobes, but this action is not very intense.\n\nM. Danysz has recently demonstrated the ready action of radium upon the\nmarrow and brain. After one hour’s exposure paralysis of the animals\nexperimented upon occurred, and the latter usually died in a few days.\n\n_Influence of Temperature upon Radiation._\n\nThere is so far but little information regarding the manner of variation\nof the radiation of radio-active bodies with temperature. We know,\nhowever, that radiation subsists at low temperatures. M. Curie placed a\nglass tube containing barium-radium chloride in liquid air. The\nluminosity of the radio-active body persisted under these conditions. At\nthe moment, indeed, of removing the tube from the cold bath, it appears\nmore luminous than at the ordinary temperature. At the temperature of\nliquid air radium continues to cause fluorescence in the sulphates of\nuranium and potassium. M. Curie has verified, by electrical\ndeterminations, that the radiation, measured at a certain distance from\nthe source, possesses the same intensity whether the radium be at the\ntemperature of the atmosphere or of liquid air. In these experiments the\nradium was placed at the bottom of a tube closed at one end. The rays\nemerged from the tube at the open end, traversed a certain space in the\nair, and were received into a condenser. The action of the rays upon the\nair of the condenser was determined both on leaving the tube in the air\nand on surrounding it to a certain height with liquid air. The same\nresult was obtained in both cases.\n\nThe radio-activity of radium persists at high temperatures.\nBarium-radium chloride after being fused (towards 800°) is radio-active\nand luminous. However, prolonged heating at a high temperature has the\neffect of temporarily lowering the radio-activity of the body. This\ndecrease is very considerable; it may constitute 75 per cent of the\ntotal radiation. The decrease is less in proportion for the absorbable\nrays than for the penetrating rays, which are to some extent suppressed\nby heating. In time the radiation of the product regains the intensity\nand composition that it possessed before heating; this occurs after the\nlapse of about two months from the occasion of heating."

Curie_\n\nAddress by\nMadame M. Curie\nat Vassar College\nMay 14, 1921\n\n[Illustration: Autograph]\n\nPREFATORY NOTE\n\nIn her recent visit to America, Madame Curie conferred a special honor\nupon Vassar College by delivering in the chapel on the evening of May\nfourteenth the only extended address which she made in this country. In\na simple, straightforward way she told the story of her great\nachievement. One realized how, closely environed by all the great\nrealities of human experience, in the face of tremendous difficulties\nand with limited resources, she had pursued undaunted her search for\ntruth.\n\nThe discovery of radium gave Madame Curie immediate distinction among\nscientists on account of the extremely significant contribution she\nthereby made to the great ultimate problem of physical science, the\nconstitution of matter. The striking properties possessed by radium gave\nto its discovery a world-wide interest, all the more intense because of\nthe hope which was inspired by the possible healing qualities of the\nradiations from this new element.\n\nThat hope is being realized in large measure. It is therefore fitting\nthat this address should have been given by Madame Curie at Vassar and\nthat it should now be circulated among the members of the college under\nthe foundation in memory of Ellen S. Richards, who devoted her life to\nthe public health.\n\nEdna Carter\nChairman of the Department of Physics.\n\nTHE DISCOVERY OF RADIUM\n\nI could tell you many things about radium and radioactivity and it would\ntake a long time. But as we can not do that, I shall only give you a\nshort account of my early work about radium. Radium is no more a baby,\nit is more than twenty years old, but the conditions of the discovery\nwere somewhat peculiar, and so it is always of interest to remember them\nand to explain them.\n\nWe must go back to the year 1897. Professor Curie and I worked at that\ntime in the laboratory of the school of Physics and Chemistry where\nProfessor Curie held his lectures. I was engaged in some work on uranium\nrays which had been discovered two years before by Professor Becquerel.\nI shall tell you how these uranium rays may be detected. If you take a\nphotographic plate and wrap it in black paper and then on this plate,\nprotected from ordinary light, put some uranium salt and leave it a day,\nand the next day the plate is developed, you notice on the plate a black\nspot at the place where the uranium salt was. This spot has been made by\nspecial rays which are given out by the uranium and are able to make an\nimpression on the plate in the same way as ordinary light. You can also\ntest those rays in another way, by placing them on an electroscope. You\nknow what an electroscope is. If you charge it, you can keep it charged\nseveral hours and more, unless uranium salts are placed near to it. But\nif this is the case the electroscope loses its charge and the gold or\naluminum leaf falls gradually in a progressive way. The speed with which\nthe leaf moves may be used as a measure of the intensity of the rays;\nthe greater the speed, the greater the intensity.\n\nI spent some time in studying the way of making good measurements of the\nuranium rays, and then I wanted to know if there were other elements,\ngiving out rays of the same kind. So I took up a work about all known\nelements, and their compounds and found that uranium compounds are\nactive and also all thorium compounds, but other elements were not found\nactive, nor were their compounds. As for the uranium and thorium\ncompounds, I found that they were active in proportion to their uranium\nor thorium content. The more uranium or thorium, the greater the\nactivity, the activity being an atomic property of the elements, uranium\nand thorium.\n\nThen I took up measurements of minerals and I found that several of\nthose which contain uranium or thorium or both were active. But then the\nactivity was not what I could expect, it was greater than for uranium or\nthorium compounds like the oxides which are almost entirely composed of\nthese elements. Then I thought that there should be in the minerals some\nunknown element having a much greater radioactivity than uranium or\nthorium. And I wanted to find and to separate that element, and I\nsettled to that work with Professor Curie. We thought it would be done\nin several weeks or months, but it was not so. It took many years of\nhard work to finish that task. There was not one new element, there were\nseveral of them. But the most important is radium which could be\nseparated in a pure state.\n\nAll the tests for the separation were done by the method of electrical\nmeasurements with some kind of electroscope. We just had to make\nchemical separations and to examine all products obtained with respect\nto their activity. The product which retained the radioactivity was\nconsidered as that one which had kept the new element; and, as the\nradioactivity was more strong in some products, we knew that we had\nsucceeded in concentrating the new element. The radioactivity was used\nin the same way as a spectroscopical test.\n\nThe difficulty was that there is not much radium in a mineral; this we\ndid not know at the beginning. But we now know that there is not even\none part of radium in a million parts of good ore. And too, to get a\nsmall quantity of pure radium salt, one is obliged to work up a huge\nquantity of ore. And that was very hard in a laboratory.\n\nWe had not even a good laboratory at that time. We worked in a hangar\nwhere there were no improvements, no good chemical arrangements. We had\nno help, no money. And because of that the work could not go on as it\nwould have done under better conditions. I did myself the numerous\ncrystalizations which were wanted to get the radium salt separated from\nthe barium salt with which it is obtained out of the ore. And in 1902 I\nfinally succeeded in getting pure radium chloride and determining the\natomic weight of the new element radium, which is 226 while that of\nbarium is only 137.\n\nLater I could also separate the metal radium, but that was a very\ndifficult work; and, as it is not necessary for the use of radium to\nhave it in this state, it is not generally prepared that way.\n\nNow, the special interest of radium is in the intensity of its rays\nwhich is several million times greater than the uranium rays. And the\neffects of the rays make the radium so important. If we take a practical\npoint of view, then the most important property of the rays is the\nproduction of physiological effects on the cells of the human organism.\nThese effects may be used for the cure of several diseases. Good results\nhave been obtained in many cases. What is considered particularly\nimportant is the treatment of cancer. The medical utilization of radium\nmakes it necessary to get that element in sufficient quantities. And so\na factory of radium was started to begin with in France, and later in\nAmerica where a big quantity of ore named carnotite is available.\nAmerica does produce many grams of radium every year but the price is\nstill very high because the quantity of radium contained in the ore is\nso small. The radium is more than a hundred thousand times dearer than\ngold.\n\nBut we must not forget that when radium was discovered no one knew that\nit would prove useful in hospitals. The work was one of pure science.\nAnd this is a proof that scientific work must not be considered from the\npoint of view of the direct usefulness of it. It must be done for\nitself, for the beauty of science, and then there is always the chance\nthat a scientific discovery may become like the radium a benefit for\nhumanity."

        "content": "But science is not rich, it does not dispose of important means, it does\nnot generally meet recognition before the material usefulness of it has\nbeen proved. The factories produce many grams of radium every year, but\nthe laboratories have very small quantities. It is the same for my\nlaboratory and I am very grateful to the American women who wish me to\nhave more of radium and give me the opportunity of doing more work with\nit.\n\nThe scientific history of radium is beautiful. The properties of the\nrays have been studied very closely. We know that particles are expelled\nfrom radium with a very great velocity near to that of the light. We\nknow that the atoms of radium are destroyed by expulsion of these\nparticles, some of which are atoms of helium. And in that way it has\nbeen proved that the radioactive elements are constantly disintegrating\nand that they produce at the end ordinary elements, principally helium\nand lead. That is, as you see, a theory of transformation of atoms which\nare not stable, as was believed before, but may undergo spontaneous\nchanges.\n\nRadium is not alone in having these properties. Many having other\nradioelements are known already, the polonium, the mesothorium, the\nradiothorium, the actinium. We know also radioactive gases, named\nemanations. There is a great variety of substances and effects in\nradioactivity. There is always a vast field left to experimentation and\nI hope that we may have some beautiful progress in the following years.\nIt is my earnest desire that some of you should carry on this scientific\nwork and keep for your ambition the determination to make a permanent\ncontribution to science.\n\nM.
